ESG REPORT 2023-24 
Next Up.  
The Next Opportunity.  
To Grow Sustainably.
We, at Infosys, are strongly inspired by the conviction that ESG, more than a corporate 
responsibility, is the opportunity to play an active role in making the world we work 
and live in more sustainable, inclusive, and equitably prosperous. The strength of 
this conviction, however, is sometimes tested. Especially through times when market 
conditions cannot be described as salubrious. Resources are finite – they get stretched. 
Margins can turn meager – fueling anxiety, and it is tempting to relegate sustainability 
initiatives to the backseat. The fact that these programs have a cost implication in 
the near-term, with positive impact, for the organization, accruing only in the mid to 
long term makes it easier to justify ‘playing defense’ and conserving resources. The 
opportunity lies in resisting that pause-it-all urge, also because companies, which don't 
drastically cut their ESG agenda, benefit from an extended market advantage, not to 
mention sustained stakeholder goodwill. Fiscal 2024 has been another year of walking 
the talk and living our purpose, at Infosys, as you can review in this ESG Report. For us, 
next up is the next opportunity to grow sustainably.

Infosys’ climate commitments
Infosys building among G20 Iconic Buildings
When India assumed the G20 presidency in 2023, it adopted the theme of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (The World is One Family). Through India's 
presidency, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) of the Government of India, together with international and country partners, aimed to showcase 
exemplary buildings and establishments to promote climate-sensitive design and behavior. The Infosys Crescent building in Bengaluru was selected 
as one of the 100 Iconic Sustainable Buildings globally and one of the 10 buildings in India by the G20 Indian Presidency. 
The Infosys Crescent building stands as a testament to the transformative power of sustainable practices. Through passive design strategies such as 
natural daylighting, efficient insulation, and climate-based shading, we have minimized our dependency on artificial lighting and created a space 
that is not only visually appealing but also energy-efficient. Our in-house-developed innovative radiant cooling systems, equipped with state-of-the-
art sensors and controls, ensure optimal indoor air quality and thermal comfort while minimizing energy consumption. 
Our commitment to sustainability extends beyond energy efficiency. Our building materials have been carefully selected for their low environmental 
impact, with a focus on recycled content and locally-sourced materials. Water-saving features, such as rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling 
systems, further underscore our dedication to resource conservation and environmental stewardship.

Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani and Prof. Amory Lovins at the book launch in September 2023.
Energy efficiency is key
Action towards climate change requires equal 
focus on reducing demand as well as shifting to 
clean energy sources. With rapid urbanization 
and increasing contribution of buildings to global 
emissions, there is an opportunity to transform our 
cities into hubs of efficiency and adopt a low-carbon 
path. Energy-efficient buildings are no longer 
an option but a necessity as this sector is seeing 
unprecedented demand in energy. 
From passive solar design to cutting-edge materials, 
from intelligent HVAC systems to energy-efficient 
lighting, the solutions are as diverse as the buildings 
themselves. The need to transition to cleaner, more 
sustainable energy systems has never been more 
urgent. Energy efficiency emerges as the lynchpin 
of this transition, a powerful tool to reduce energy 
consumption while maintaining or even enhancing 
the quality of our lives. Striking the right balance 
between energy efficiency and comfort would bring 
in benefits on health and environment, cost savings, 
comfort, and durability.
Pioneering Net Zero Buildings | The Infosys Journey
Climate change advocacy
In this context, Infosys published a book “Pioneering 
Net Zero Buildings – The Infosys Journey”, 
chronicling Infosys’ efforts towards creating 
super-efficient buildings, thereby minimizing 
environmental impact.
The book launch was held in the Infosys Bangalore 
campus on September 11, 2023. The occasion was 
graced by Prof. Amory Lovins, American writer, 
energy advisor, physicist, and Chairman Emeritus of 
the Rocky Mountain Institute. He is also renowned 
for his work as an integrated designer of super-
efficient buildings. He was joined by Nandan 
Nilekani, Chairman, Infosys. They engaged in a 
fireside chat to discuss technologies of the future 
that can help decarbonization at scale and speed for 
a Net Zero planet.
Pioneering change  
The book provides a detailed account of energy 
conservation being one of the main pillars in 
achieving carbon neutrality at Infosys. The unique 
methodology, disruptive technologies and new 
benchmarks in buildings, captured in the book, 
are expected to guide and inspire companies, 
policymakers, academia, and other stakeholders in 
the industry. 
At Infosys, we believe that meeting global climate 
goals requires shared learning and collective efforts 
by all stakeholders.
The case studies illuminate the achievements 
that can be realized when architects, engineers, 
researchers, builders, and policymakers join forces in 
the spirit of innovation and sustainability.  
While it provides performance benchmarks, it 
acknowledges that, in the complex puzzle of 
sustainability, there are no silver bullets. There is 
a need to learn from both triumphs and setbacks, 
to build a collective understanding among 
various stakeholders of what it means to create 
infrastructure with minimum environmental 
impact. The right approach to Net Zero emissions 
and meeting global climate goals is only possible 
through collective efforts of all stakeholders.

Holistic approach to 
emission reduction
Most of the work around green buildings revolves 
around reducing operational costs by designing 
buildings efficiently, resulting in energy and 
water savings. It is important to consider a holistic 
approach that includes the life cycle carbon 
assessment of the building. Emissions related 
to extraction of raw materials, transportation of 
materials to site, and construction – termed as 
embodied emissions – contribute to the overall 
emissions of buildings. Though significant in 
a building life cycle, the embodied emissions 
calculations are not commonplace currently due 
to the efforts involved in sourcing material-related 
carbon data and tracking each material from its 
origin to site. To strengthen this evolving area of 
study and our commitment to decarbonization and 
environmental stewardship, life cycle assessment 
has been taken up for every new building at Infosys 
to understand the embodied carbon up to the 
construction stage and explore opportunities for 
reduction.
We have conducted an embodied carbon analysis 
for our upcoming buildings, adhering to the ISO 
14040-44 standard. We have focused our analysis 
specifically on the product stage (A1-A3), which 
includes raw material supply (A1), transportation 
(A2) and manufacturing (A3). 
Our analysis has revealed a range of embodied 
carbon emissions, from 650 kgCO2e/sqm to 
750 kgCO2e/sqm, attributable to A1-A3 stage 
only. It's important to note that our analysis has 
concentrated solely on core and shell structure 
and facade elements, recognizing their significant 
contribution (over 75%) to the building's embodied 
carbon footprint. By conducting this comprehensive 
analysis, we are better equipped to make informed 
decisions regarding material selection, design 
choices, and construction methods, with the 
ultimate aim of minimizing our environmental 
impact and advancing sustainability within the built 
environment. 
Our progress on  
green buildings
29.6 million sq. ft. of green buildings  
with the highest level of certification
The benefits of green buildings extend far beyond 
certifications, offering a multitude of advantages 
to both occupants and the environment. Through 
innovative design, construction, and operation 
practices, green buildings significantly reduce 
carbon emissions, mitigate climate change, and 
enhance energy efficiency. By incorporating energy-
efficient features, such as advanced insulation, 
efficient HVAC systems, and accurate monitoring 
and control, these buildings minimize operational

Climate action  
at Infosys 
At Infosys, we are mindful of enforcing climate 
actions across our business and operations. We 
continue to be carbon neutral, for the fifth year in 
a row. We have made a mark in the global industry 
as a stalwart in green buildings, earning the highest 
level of green buildings certification for 29.6 million 
sq. ft. of our buildings. We continue to reduce our 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and are involved in 
several carbon offset projects across the country. 
These projects are not just instrumental in offsetting 
our carbon footprint but also create opportunities 
for communities to improve their health and 
education. We also engage meaningfully with 
clients to build products and services that will help 
them in their ESG performance. 
Our approach to reducing emissions is three-fold:

Workplace transformation
Workplace transformation is currently being 
implemented at scale at Infosys. The reimagined 
workplace supports people to work in the 
hybrid mode and encourages people to work 
collaboratively. Transformed workplace aligning to 
the new normal increases productivity, health and 
wellness and provides a refreshing experience to 
the employees, while ensuring efficient usage of 
resources.

Offices in tier-2 cities  
With many employees preferring to work out 
of their base locations in tier-2 and 3 cities 
following the COVID-19 pandemic, Infosys made 
a strategic decision to open offices in tier-2 
cities to help them work locally. This strategy is 
expected to have a two-fold impact: It can boost 
the local ecosystem and reduce construction in 
the big cities, thereby reducing pollution and 
water stress. In line with this strategy, in fiscal 
2024, we opened two offices in Visakhapatnam 
(Andhra Pradesh) and Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu) 
respectively.

Decarbonizing   
our value chain
Infosys has been a leader in climate action for many 
years due to its affirmative action in mitigating 
climate change impacts. This has led to the framing 
of Infosys’ ambitious ESG Vision 2030 and signing of  
The Climate Pledge to be net zero by 2040. Infosys 
has been reporting environmental information 
through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for 
close to two decades and has actively undertaken 
efforts to reduce environmental impact of its 
operations, promote environmental stewardship 
in its supply chain and mitigate risk. To meet 
these ambitious targets, Infosys expects its supply 
chain partners also to align and move in the same 
direction. Infosys embarked on a supply chain 
decarbonization journey during this financial year. 
Purpose of the initiative
To achieve meaningful progress in our climate 
action journey, it is crucial for suppliers to align 
their climate change ambitions with Infosys and 
work together towards a common goal. This will 
enable the entire ecosystem to grow and move 
towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. 
Learnings from this journey will help us ensure that 
the entire supply chain is equipped to handle future 
regulatory requirements by having an early mover 
advantage and implement strategies to combat 
climate change, more effectively. 
Action
In order to support early adoption, we organized 
four in-person training sessions for our suppliers, 
representing a large part of our capex. The 
sessions focused on climate change and the 
knowledge required to facilitate accurate climate 
change disclosures including best practices in 
monitoring, maintaining, and improving data 
capture methodologies, emissions monitoring as 
well as calculation techniques applicable to the 
organization. The workshops leveraged Infosys’ 
benchmark practices in environmental sustainability 
while offering learners an opportunity to experience 
our campuses, which are also referred to as ‘living 
labs’ for clean technologies.  
Way forward
Climate change impact reduction is not possible 
without collective action. We believe our efforts 
will catalyze climate change actions across the 
supply chain. The engagement with our suppliers 
will enable us to have more accurate data and this 
in turn will facilitate the procurement of products 
that are manufactured in a climate-friendly manner 
from environmentally-conscious suppliers resulting 
in overall climate change impact reduction. While 
delivering this, our valued suppliers would have also 
embarked on the journey of climate action.

A Biogas unit at a farmer’s home.
Climate action and gender equity through household biogas
More than 70% of rural households(1) still use the 
traditional three stone stoves. 
Some households that have LPG connection under 
government schemes cannot afford the recurring 
refill cost. Constant supply is also difficult in remote 
areas. Women and girls often spend a significant 
amount of time collecting firewood, which not only 
endangers their safety but also requires them to 
engage in more menial tasks. With women being 
predominantly responsible for cooking, this can 
limit their opportunities for education, employment, 
and personal development. Traditional cooking 
methods also generate a lot of smoke from cooking 
resulting in GHG emissions. This affects the health of 
women and children in the household.
In the risk that these women were facing, the 
Infosys team found an opportunity to address two 
issues – climate change and gender inequity. An 
opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
and also empower women.
The biogas units supplied by Infosys have been 
installed in the households of small and marginal 
farmers in rural areas. A detailed document 
capturing the project is given here:
Whitepaper on biogas (infosys.com)
Continued benefit through carbon offset project
Infosys carbon offset projects have been designed to create both social and environmental impact. The 
projects, which are being implemented since 2016, continue to benefit more than 2,64,000 families, through 
the improved cook stoves and the biogas units distributed to rural farmers. Here are some examples:
The Ramanagara biogas project, which was implemented in 2016, continues to function well and benefit 7,620 
beneficiaries. Their lives have changed for the better, thanks to the beneficial schemes for the government, their 
own tireless work and the biogas units distributed by Infosys. The avoided spend on LPG and better health due 
to smokeless cooking have contributed to their overall well-being.
Meanwhile, the cookstove project in Meghalaya is helping women significantly. The Garo communities in this 
region rely on the forest for their energy needs. This requires the women of the families to walk deep into the 
mountainous forest to bring back heavy loads of wood in bamboo baskets strapped to their heads. Most of 
their time every day is spent in thus collecting firewood. The improved cook stoves distributed by Infosys have 
reduced the firewood collection trips by half, in addition to improving the indoor air quality in the households. 
This has improved their overall livelihoods and given the women the opportunity to spend their time doing 
more meaningful work.

Improving digital literacy of women through carbon offset projects
Infosys carbon offset projects have enhanced the lives of more than 2,64,000 households through the social, 
economic and environmental benefits created by the program. One such benefit is the digital literacy created 
by the program.
Our project partners have been equipping women 'monitors' (women identified to monitor the projects), to 
use digital technology for beneficiary identification, distribution and monitoring of the project. In general, 
men have more access to technology or devices in rural settings and this initiative has largely helped bridge 
the gender gap.

Our project in Rajasthan
The digital monitoring journey in Rajasthan began 
in 2020. It started with a pilot project in which basic 
smartphones were given to five monitors. Soon 
enough, the partners realized the challenges of 
rural India. The battery of the basic smartphones 
was getting drained quickly and without electricity, 
the women could not charge the phones. Network 
reception was either not available or extremely 
poor and the applications did not work. There was 
also general scepticism among rural women to 
its potential dangers if used inappropriately. The 
monitors are also eager to teach their children how 
to use these smartphones.
One such story is that of Nirmala Devi from 
Kojawada, who never used a smartphone before 
but now is monitoring the condition of cookstoves 
for several households in her village and updating 
them on the app regularly. She found that digital 
monitoring can eliminate all the manual paperwork 
she used to do for monitoring and billing, it also 
helps her understand her monitoring percentage 
effectively and plan the month accordingly. She 
then started to use her smartphone to watch 
the local news and now feels empowered. She 
takes pride in working for the betterment of the 
health of the village women and the environment 
through the cookstoves initiative and emphasizes 
the importance of the smartphone and digital 
technology in easing this journey for her. 
Our project in Nagpur
In Nagpur, Maharashtra, many women in the project 
were initially unfamiliar with modern technology, 
and have undergone a transformative journey in 
embracing digital literacy. With the use of advanced 
software for data collection, the volunteers, 
especially 12 monitors, have successfully conducted 
surveys essential for the biogas project. The project 
provided these women with a unique opportunity 
to develop practical skills in using smartphones 
and specialized software. As they engaged in data 
collection related to the working condition of 
biogas plants, they acquired proficiency in handling 
digital devices, navigating software interfaces, and 
ensuring accurate and efficient data entry.
The newfound digital literacy skills have translated 
into tangible economic benefits for these women. 
Beyond personal empowerment, these women 
have become inspirational figures within their 
communities. Their success stories are contributing 
to changing societal perceptions about women's 
capabilities, challenging traditional gender roles, 
and fostering a more inclusive environment. With 
their newfound skills, they are better positioned 
to explore further opportunities in the digital 
economy, enhancing their long-term prospect.
use smartphones due to lack of knowledge and 
understanding of the technology. 
Basic phones were replaced with smartphones and 
in the last four years, the project partners at Udaipur 
have conducted relentless training and capacity 
building of the monitors. As a result, today, 400 
monitors are monitoring the cookstoves usage of 
almost 50,000 households.
The project partner, in their training sessions, have 
always emphasized on the appropriate way to use 
smartphones and have spread awareness about

GHG emissions tracking for biofuels 
For a leading sugar manufacturer, Infosys enabled 
accurate tracking of embedded carbon in the 
manufacturing and transport of ethanol as biofuel. 
Infosys’ solution helped the client to calculate 
sustainability characteristics of the bioethanol from 
the farm to the gate of the customer. The solution 
ensured high accuracy and traceability of data entry 
compliant with RED reporting directive.
Data platform for green investing 
For an investment management division of one of 
the world's largest asset management companies, 
Infosys implemented MSCI- and TCFD-based 
methodologies by defining a large set of KPIs 
and derived metrics tracked for reporting the 
fixed-income fund universe. Infosys leveraged 
the best practices defined by its ESG intelligence 
cloud solution framework for the solution, which 
helped the client and its end consumers with 
accurate regulatory reporting of enriched ESG 
metrics benchmarking of portfolios based on ESG 
performance factors, effective measurement of risk 
and thereby sustained long-term value creation.
Supply chain risk due diligence 
For a leading Nordic Bank, Infosys helped to

employees GHG emissions data (Scope 1, 2, and 3). 
Enhanced sustainability reporting with streamlined 
and automated emissions reporting ensure accurate 
GHG emission calculations for the dedicated facility 
for the client, and supply chain due diligence 
compliance. 
The supplier risk assessment methodology was 
analyzed for the client and Infosys against Corporate 
Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) 
requirements and this helped develop an improved 
risk management plan.
Gamified solution to improve ESG 
behavior of tenants 
For a leading real estate developer in the South 
Asia region, Infosys developed an integrated data 
platform aimed to help its tenants and employees 
capture and report their sustainability data. The 
end-user app enables tenant employees to engage 
in adopting sustainable practices in their daily work 
and get rewarded through coupons and equivalent 
rewards. The platform gamifies sustainability 
practices. 
Enhancing green IT awareness 
For one of the largest European banks, Infosys

A large Australian bank wanted to be the leader in 
green loans in the market. Infosys assisted them by 
creating end-to-end lending originations process 
flows for all green loans and implementing the same 
across the various systems and processes of the 
bank. The wider lending rules and processes were 
updated to the new environmentally responsible 
policy and processes through workshops and online 
sessions. Specific training courses were created 
to empower teams and individuals to build a 
sustainable culture across the organization. 
Enablon incident management 
For a large railroad major, Infosys played a pivotal 
role in the successful implementation of Enablon 
Go desktop and mobile version of the incident 
management module. Infosys ensured a seamless 
integration of the module, enabling them with real-
time hazard identification, incident reporting and 
risk mitigation, which not only prioritized worker 
safety but also optimized operations providing the

WATER 
Around two billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water today. Only 0.5% of water on 
Earth is useable and available as freshwater, and climate change is dangerously affecting that supply. Statistics 
show that at least 50% of the world’s population – around four billion people – live under highly water-stressed 
conditions for at least one month of the year. These levels of water stress put people’s lives, jobs, food, and 
energy security at risk. Without better water management, water stress is set to worsen with population 
growth, economic development and climate change. Sustainable water management is pivotal to building the 
resilience of societies and ecosystems and reducing carbon emissions. 
Infosys operations span across countries that are declared highly water-stressed based on World Resources 
Institute (WRI) and local studies. This has led us to recognize water security risks and we are committed to 
sustainable water management through enhancing our operational water conservation processes and 
expanding our community outreach. The details of water withdrawal in water stress zones is available in the 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) that forms part of the Infosys Integrated Annual Report. 
Our strategies on water conservation are achieved through the 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) approach. We are 
determined to reduce our water footprint and enhance water availability in the communities where we operate 
through focused efforts on this front. 
Our water strategy
We have adopted a ‘Planet Positive’ approach by implementing comprehensive water conservation and 
rejuvenation strategies. This approach encompasses several initiatives, such as efficient water management 
practices, rigorous reporting practices, identification and addressal of water leaks, integration of new 
technologies that minimize water usage, construction of rainwater harvesting structures, adoption of ponds 
for water storage catering to both reuse of harvested rainwater and recharge of underwater aquifers, and 
advocating to stakeholders on water conservation. 
The various facets of our strategy
A. Low water design
Our strategies begin with the design of our 
buildings, ensuring use of an integrated water 
management approach to ensure minimization of 
water impacts through operations. Water demand is 
minimized by measures like low-flow fixtures, dual 
flush toilets, pressure regulating valves and smart 
metering. Water savings is also achieved with: 
•	
Incorporation of aspects such as subsoil drainage 
system below the basement parking to ensure 
no water pressure on the structure, thereby also 
collecting subsoil water for use in landscaping 
and cleaning
•	
Roof rainwater harvesting infrastructure to 
ensure utilization of harnessed water for potable 
purpose
•	
Surface rainwater recharged into the ground 
water tables through injection wells
•	
Installation of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) 
to recycle the wastewater generated in the 
campus, which is used for flushing, landscaping 
and cooling tower makeup water requirement, 
making our campuses a zero-discharge facility.
B. Conservation practices 
Water is used for human touch purposes only at 
Infosys and 100% of our water withdrawal from 
various sources has Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), 
which is less than 1,000 mg/L. Thus, it is considered 
as freshwater and most of our withdrawal is through 
municipal providers. To conserve freshwater in 
existing buildings, we take measures to reduce 
demand and 100% of wastewater is recycled within 
our campuses. Water distribution and treatment 
strategies have been enhanced with re-engineering 
and modifications. Real-time monitoring of data is 
done with smart water metering systems.

1.	
Smart water metering 
Smart water meters have helped us plug leaks, 
identify opportunities for savings and get 
valuable insights for new designs. We have 
leveraged technology to monitor and control 
our water consumption leading to significant 
reduction in per capita consumption per day 
over the years.
2.	
Smart irrigation systems 
This is an initiative which helps reduce 
landscape irrigation by planning with lesser 
grass cover, use of native species and continued 
development of irrigation infrastructure like 
automated irrigation and drip irrigation, among 
others.
C. Wastewater management
Wastewater across our campuses is entirely 
recycled and used for irrigation, flushing and 
air-conditioning. We are retrofitting our existing 
systems to upgrade the quality of treated 
wastewater in line with applicable norms. We 
manage around 31 STPs across India locations to 
handle around 19.4 MLD of sewage. Of the 31 STPs, 
28 STPs operate on the latest Membrane BioReactor 
(MBR) technology. The 40 KLD Sequential Batch 
Reactor (SBR) plant at our Gurgaon campus was 
converted to MBR during fiscal 2024. During the 
year, we recycled 100% of wastewater generated 
31 STPs with total treatment capacity of  
19.4 MLD in India campuses 
on our campuses through STPs to the tune of 
12,70,284.01 KL and have reduced the requirement 
of freshwater sourcing to that extent.
D. Rainwater harvesting
An important feature of our water stewardship 
goal is rainwater harvesting. Our India campuses 
are equipped with rooftop rainwater harvesting, 
harvesting tanks, recharge wells and artificial lakes. 
These reduce our external freshwater dependency 
and help to replenish the groundwater table in 
the areas we operate in. During the year, roof 
rainwater harvesting system was implemented 
at our campuses in Thiruvananthapuram, Mysuru 
and Bhubaneswar. Around 24,000 sq.m. area of 
roof was enabled with rainwater harvesting in 
fiscal 2024. Rainwater intake has been increased 
by 16% compared to fiscal 2023. Around 14% of 
the total consumption was met through rainwater 
harvesting. 
Roof rainwater harvesting
Most of our buildings are enabled with roof 
rainwater collection and filtration mechanism. This 
water is being used for primary applications after 
necessary treatment. Rooftop rainwater harvesting 
systems have helped us offset freshwater purchases 
from external sources.
Around 18.5 lakh sq. ft. of roof area  
enabled with rainwater harvesting
Surface run-off water collection 
through artificial lakes 
We have created 40 lakes across our India campuses, 
with a holding capacity of 430 million liters of 
rainwater. Water from these lakes have been reused 
for secondary purposes after necessary treatment. 
We have observed a significant increase in water 
tables in the areas where we have created these 
lakes.
Injection wells for  
groundwater recharge
We have created around 405 deep injection wells 
across our campuses in India, having a combined 
recharge capacity of over 20 million liters.

and solid waste severely polluted its waters, 
disrupting the delicate balance of its ecosystem. 
The consequent decline in water holding capacity, 
compounded by silt deposition and groundwater 
contamination, posed significant health and 
environmental hazards to the local community. The 
stagnant sewage deposits caused an unbearable 
stench in the area. Additionally, the reduced 
capacity of the lake caused an overflow and 
flooding of the surroundings during the monsoon.
Today, this once-polluted lake has been cleaned 
and made ready for the monsoon, thanks to the 
Foundation’s efforts. Additionally, a walking track 
of about 2 km, afforestation with 1,600 trees and 
10,000 plants has improved the surroundings 
significantly. This is an example of our lake 
rejuvenation initiatives covering five lakes and 
successfully transforming 197 acres of once-
neglected water bodies into thriving ecosystems. 
The plans included objectives of storage capacity 
enhancement, groundwater recharge, drinking 
water accessibility, agricultural support, catchment 
area improvement, environmental sustainability, 
community engagement, and creating a space to 
promote residents’ health and wellness.

We procure secondary quality water through 
authorized agencies / authorities to meet the 
demand for landscaping applications. This helps 
us reduce our freshwater dependency. During the 
year, we procured 55,589 KL of greywater at our 
Bengaluru and Hyderabad campuses.
F. Leadership and advocacy
Infosys is committed to addressing environmental 
challenges and driving change as a responsible 
member of the community. We exhibit our water 
stewardship through a combination of efforts within 
the organization as well as among communities, 
such as rejuvenation of lakes in the vicinity of 
our campuses. We actively engage with multiple 
stakeholders to not only drive awareness but also 
share best practices that can be replicated at scale. 
G. Employee engagement 
We proactively engage with our employees to create 
ambassadors for water conservation. On World 
Water Day in March 2024, we promoted awareness 
on the water conservation approach of Infosys as 
well as methods that can be adopted by employees 
at their homes and communities. Stalls with displays 
of the latest technological interventions for water 
conservation were organized across locations. Some 
of the other initiatives included water management-
based site tour for employees, sessions on water 
management at Infosys, poster displays and 
communication mailers.

H. Water quality and compliance
We have made it a priority to maintain the quality 
of the water we use and discharge so that it will 
be suitable for its next use, contributing to the 
overall health of local watersheds. We adhere to 
statutory norms and regulations in all the states and 
countries where we operate and maintain careful 
monitoring systems to track the same. We have 
also established a real-time wastewater quality 
and quantity monitoring system and strengthened 
water quality inspection mechanism by integrating 
it to our online Building Management System (BMS) 
to monitor the data.
Going beyond legal and regulatory obligations, 
at Infosys, we have always been at the forefront 
of ensuring compliance through responsible 
business practices. As a global company, we abide 
by all international and national laws and uphold 
the standards of transparency and accountability. 
We ensure adherence to all applicable legal 
requirements in the regions we operate in, including 
India’s Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) 
Act, 1974 and the Central Ground Water Authority 
(CGWA) guidelines.
I. Incremental efforts for water positivity
Water stewardship in the community
Water is a scarce and invaluable natural resource, 
and we are strongly committed to its conservation. 
Infosys has been a signatory to the CEO Water 
Mandate, since 2014. We continue to strengthen our 
water stewardship practices in our operations and 
extend our efforts to the community. Here is a case 
study of a lake revival project in Bengaluru through 
the Infosys Foundation.
Doddathogur Lake, located in the south of 
Bengaluru; was once a vital drinking water source. 
However, the unchecked discharge of sewage 
Infosys regularly assesses water-related risks. In 
2022-2023, CII conducted Scope-1 water footprint 
audit at Infosys’ E-city campus in Bengaluru, 
defining real water resource offsets covering both 
quantity and quality offsets (based on direct or real 
water used for the plant operations) criteria as per 
NITI Aayog guidelines. The assessment showed that 
direct water use, and indirect energy water use in 
facilities amounts for less than 1% of E-city campus 
overall water footprint. 
As an outcome of the audit, Infosys Bangalore DC 
successfully achieved the Scope 1 Certification 
and was recognized as an “Aspiring Water Neutral 
/ Positive Campus” during the 9th CII Water 
Innovation Summit on December 12-13, 2023, at 
New Delhi.

Waste management
According to The World Counts website, human beings dump so much waste on Earth in a year that if all 
this waste was put on trucks, they would go around the world 24 times. Another World Bank study said the 
current global waste generation levels are approximately 1.3 billion tons per year and is expected to increase 
to approximately 2.2 billion tons per year by 2025. This represents a significant increase in per capita waste 
generation rates, from 1.2 to 1.42 kg per person per day. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC), municipal solid waste is expected to reach approximately 3.4 Gt by 2050. All these statistics 
show that waste management is a crucial challenge globally and the time to act on it is now.
Material recovery from waste – Recycle
Composting
Composting practices comprising manual vermicomposting beds and organic waste converters are used to 
convert landscape / garden waste into compost, which is then used as organic manure in our landscaping 
applications. 
Biogas
•	
Our campuses have been equipped with biogas 
plants, which is based on the bio-methanation 
process to manage food waste and landscaping 
waste. The resultant biogas generated serves 
as a substitute for LPG in our food courts. The 
by-product slurry is dried through sludge drying 
beds near our biogas facilities and is used as 
manure for landscaping within our campus.
•	
The bio-methanation plants / bioreactors 
in Infosys are high-rate digesters where the 
organic loading rate is significantly higher even 
when it is loaded close to its rated capacity. The 
quantum of biogas generated, reused and the 
LPG equivalent for the same across biogas plants 
installed in India is tabulated below.

Infosys recognizes the importance of dealing 
with waste in a manner that does not negatively 
impact earth. Our waste strategy encompasses the 
principles of Reduce, Reuse, Refurbish, Repurpose, 
and Recycle. By actively minimizing waste, investing 
in recycling equipment, and optimizing systems 
and procedures, we hope to achieve our goal of 
zero waste to landfills. We contribute to a circular 
economy through our efforts on conversion of 
waste into resources and working with suppliers 
who support achieving the same. Infosys has 
implemented comprehensive waste management 
procedures, emphasizing the collection, sorting, and 
elimination of waste. Infosys' waste management 
practices include source segregation, secondary 
segregation, effective waste processing and 
collection, recycling, and efficient disposal of all 
wastes in compliance with relevant laws. This makes 
it possible to lessen adverse environmental effects.
Our environmental ambitions to be carbon 
neutral each year focuses on making abstemious 
use of fresh water and recycling 100% of waste 
water, while ensuring zero waste to landfill. Our 
progress is reported through our annual ESG report 
publications.
Waste handling at source 
The basic categories into which we classify waste 
are hazardous and non-hazardous. Based on the 
generation at the campus, the waste is monitored 
and managed. It is a common practice to store 
different types of waste separately. Bins are 
color coded / labeled according to the different 
categories of waste to aid segregation at source. 
We ensure adherence to legal requirements for 
storage, transportation as applicable in instances 
like hazardous waste.
Vermicomposting is practiced in 6 of our 
campuses - Bhubaneshwar SEZ and STPI, 
Mangaluru, Pune Phase 1 and 2 and Jaipur.  
We generated and reused 755.28 MT of 
vermicompost in fiscal 2024.

Waste
Construction and  
demolition waste
Of the construction and demolition waste 
generated across India locations amounting to 
38,340.11 tons, we sent 35,961.97 tons to an 
authorized recycler who manufactured bricks and 
blocks using the debris and reused for land leveling 
during the year. 
Other waste
Paper, plastic, metal waste etc., are recycled, 
transformed into new forms of use, and then 
recirculated into the supply chain. 
Material recovery from waste – 
Reuse
We pursue a waste hierarchy, and we prefer reuse 
over recycling. Waste generated at source gets 
segregated and evaluated for reuse. Construction 
and demolition waste is sent to government 
authorized landfill sites, which is reused for land 
levelling and other purposes by the municipal 
corporation. Used oil from kitchens is utilized 
in biogas plants as it has high codigestion COD 
(Chemical Oxygen Demand) levels, which in turn 
generates increased biogas. Dried section sludge 
from STP and biogas slurry are reused as manure 
within campus. During the year, 804.99 tons of 
manure was generated and used in our campuses.
Waste to energy: Co-processing 
Co-processing achieves a superior environmental 
performance as compared to landfill and 
incineration, which can be demonstrated through 
lifecycle assessment of waste. The process involves 
use of waste as a raw material or source of energy 
in place of natural mineral resources and fossil 
fuels. Waste with a high calorific value that cannot 
be recycled or repurposed is typically chosen for 
co-processing. Some waste materials collected by 
Infosys are sent to be co-processed, including tetra 
packs, tea bags, rubber waste, paper packaging, 
low-value plastic, plastic gunny bags, thermocol, 
foam, carpets, discarded mop refills, ceramic waste, 
flex banners, artificial grass mats, floor mats, glass 
waste, etc.
Waste disposal options
The stringent laws regulated by the Central Pollution 
Control Board (CPCB) and the State Pollution Control 
Board (SPCB) guidelines for hazardous waste such as 
bio-medical waste, oil-soaked cotton, oil filters from 
DG sets, and other wastes are disposed of through 
authorized agencies. These agencies incinerate the 
waste as per prescribed guidelines. The resultant ash 
is sent to Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility (TSDF) 
landfills for safe disposal and in a few locations, it is 
diverted for cement manufacturing. 
We focused our efforts over the years on diversion 
of municipal solid waste generated on our facilities, 
which we address as mixed waste. We have 
dedicated authorized vendor partners who support 
us on collection, sorting and disposal of this waste 
to ensure minimal waste to landfills and maximize 
recycling. 
We have diverted 95.03% of waste  
from landfills during the year.
E-waste management
As we are an IT company, e-waste generation 
is inevitable. We have been persistent in our 
efforts to ensure that we reduce, reuse, recycle 
and dispose e-waste responsibly. Our e-waste 
includes IT equipment, mobile phones, printers, 
cartridges, electrical and electronic equipment 
like refrigerators, microwaves, air conditioners, 
lithium-ion batteries, and cables, among others. 
E-waste is disposed to authorized recyclers, and 
refurbishers who provide us certificates on the 
successful recycling and recovery of the material. 
The authorized recyclers / refurbishers are 
evaluated based on adherence to applicable legal 
requirements and extent of resource circularity in 
their process. 
TRUE Zero Waste Certification
Infosys has an ambition of zero waste to landfill 
and one of the steps we have undertaken to 
achieve this is the TRUE certification program. This 
program measures, improves and recognizes zero 
waste performance by encouraging the adoption 
of sustainable resource management and waste 
reduction practices that contribute to positive 
environmental, health and economic outcomes. It 
enables us to divert all solid waste from the landfill 
and incineration from going into landfills. 
During the year, our owned campuses in Bengaluru, 
Chennai MCity and Pune - Phase 2 have been 
Certified under TRUE Zero Waste by Green Business 
Certification Inc. (GBCI).
Waste vendor evaluation
At Infosys, our green procurement policy ensures 
rigorous vendor evaluation. Waste vendors 
undergo a detailed vendor site audit against several 
regulatory requirements. Post this, commercial 
proposals are invited and scrutinized to ensure 
they comply with requirements. The proposals are 
then shared with the commercial team for further 
negotiations, if any. Once this process is completed, 
a formal agreement is entered into with the vendors. 
A total of 83 vendors are being evaluated as per the 
compliance. Vendors are audited annually based on 
the waste vendor checklist.
Employee engagement on waste
To achieve our ambition of zero waste to landfill, we 
engage with our employees continually to create 
ambassadors and carry forward the initiatives 
to the communities they live in, thus impacting 
the larger ecosystem. Many interventions were 
conducted across locations during the year, which 
included communication through mailers, activities 
on “Beat plastic pollution”, distribution of manure 
to employees, awareness sessions, distributed 
sustainable products, drives on waste plogging in 
areas surrounding campuses or other localities with 
the involvement of employees, and engagement of 
school students on sustainable products.

Case study – Building demolition and recycling
A significant portion of Infosys operational footprint stems from our buildings, we prioritize sustainability 
throughout their life cycle – from design and construction to eventual decommissioning and responsible 
management of construction and demolition (C&D) waste. Our commitment is to divert waste away from 
landfills by applying the Reduce, Reuse, Recycle (3R) hierarchy. 
Responsible demolition and waste management 
practices play a critical role in this commitment, 
ensuring we minimize environmental impact 
whenever the building is demolished.
Our demolition strategy tackles a building in two 
phases:
1.	
Interior disassembly  
Here, we focus on giving materials a second life.
Workstations, chairs, and office furniture are 
examined for resuability. Depending on the 
condition, we either reuse them within Infosys 
or hand them over to authorized / approved 
Glass is carefully dismantled for reuse
vendors who refurbish and resell them in the 
secondary market. This reduces the demand for 
new furniture production and keeps valuable 
materials out of landfills.
2.	
Main structure and exterior deconstruction 
This emphasizes sorting the waste at source 
during the demolition stage while paying 
careful attention to the possibility of reusing 
materials, including:
Metals: Scrap metals such as aluminium, steel, 
etc., get a new life through certified recyclers. 
This not only reduces landfill use but also 
minimizes the need for virgin metal extraction.
Glass: The glass from the windows is 
dismantled and sent to recyclers, who then 
convert it to cullets before sending it back to 
the glass manufacturing process.
Concrete and Blocks: Crushed concrete and 
blocks are diverted to authorized recycling 
concrete product manufacturing factories, 
where the material is used for making new 
blocks. Thus reducing the need for virgin 
material. 
Project managers and the team closely track waste 
throughout the demolition process. Contractors 
are held accountable for proper on-site separation 
and storage of materials in a designated waste yard, 
ensuring efficient management.
While we build new buildings, we give preference to 
the use of recycled materials.
To ensure transparency, all waste diverted for 
recycling or reuse is meticulously weighed and 
recorded, with supporting documentation obtained 
from certified haulers and dealers.
Thanks to the stringent processes we have in place, 
we are steadily moving towards zero waste to 
landfill for our C&D waste and facilitating a circular 
economy.

Environmental compliance
We have a strong environmental management 
system aligned with ISO 14001:2015 standards 
across all India locations in line with our HSE 
strategy and covers a significant portion of 
the employees across the organization. The 
management system is implemented across 
locations globally based on applicable legal 
requirements and internal benchmarks and are a 
part of our internal audit coverage.
We ensure adherence to the applicable legal 
requirements across our locations. We conduct 
environmental impact assessments for all our 
routine and non-routine activities and the 
significant concerns creating an environmental 
impact include depletion of resources like power 
and water, waste generation and disposal, and 
emissions that are part of our material aspects.
Environmental impacts of new services, activities 
and changes in process or legislations are also 
conducted. We conduct environmental impact 
assessment studies for all new projects, wherever 
applicable, covering impacts related to air, water, 
social aspects, and biodiversity, among others.
No cases of monetary or non-monetary sanctions 
for violations have been reported in fiscal 2024. 
A process for monitoring requirements in line with 
legal requirements is established and we ensure 
that all parameters are always maintained well 
within the defined norms.

Enabling digital talent at scale
Enhancing skills and amplifying human potential
Infosys recognizes and acknowledges this Human + AI era. The sentient mindset has propelled us to constantly 
invest in people and the ecosystem that will augment their skillsets and potential to navigate through 
technology and business waves. Fiscal 2024 saw continued investment in creating relevant opportunities to 
skill employees, client teams, and societal talent pools. 
Employees 
We endeavor to provide employees with new 
learning experiences and future-ready skills through 
two large interventions— the foundation program 
and the continuous education program. 
We are now experiencing the play of Human + AI in 
multiple fields, including learning. This technology 
wave gives us the ability to hyper-personalize 
learning, at scale. In addition to infusing GenAI 
components into the digital learning platform, we 
have also created a spectrum of AI skills that applies 
to AI consumers and AI creators alike.
The foundation training program is designed to 
mold newly-onboarded entry-level engineering and 
science graduates into corporate professionals. The 
continuous education program aims at upskilling or 
reskilling existing employees and sets the tone for 
lifelong learning.
Foundation education program
The Infosys foundation education program is a 16- 
to 19-week residential training program to enable 
entry-level engineering and science graduates 
transition into the corporate world. This program 
focuses on IT foundation skills and one of the many 
technologies based on business requirements. The 
program includes both process training as well as 
professional and behavioral skills training.
Trainees can also choose learning paths in Lex, 
our internal learning platform, based on their 
interest areas, and equip themselves with internal 
certifications to move faster in their careers. In the 
recent past, gen AI and prompt engineering-related 
topics were included in the foundation program to 
provide entry-level graduates an exposure to the 
latest technologies.

Continuous education program
2.	
Assessments: We have a robust virtual 
proctoring and GenAI-backed mechanism 
that has helped us adopt subjective and more 
immersive practical learning assessments. The 
GenAI infusion has helped us craft creative 
assessments facilitating mock assessments and 
opportunities to prepare talent for a variety 
of interviews while giving them the ability to 
refine their responses too. 
3.	
Credentials: The digital learning platform 
has leveraged blockchain to secure learning 
credentials for our learners and we have 
also reused the India tech stack of verifiable 
certificates to ensure we have clear authenticity 
and mechanism. 
Over 1 million certifications  
for our employees, clients and learners  
on Infosys Springboard
4.	
AR / VR content: We leveraged augmented 
reality / virtual reality (AR / VR) to create a visual 
learning pathway that gamifies the learning 
experience, complete with pit stops for reaching 
out to subject matter experts (SMEs), requesting 
and registering for training for a topic. 
Case study: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
we leveraged AR / VR capabilities to create a 
self-driving game in Unity that would help 
learners imbibe the concepts. To democratize 
content creation, the authoring platform has a 
predefined component to help SMEs leverage 
AR / VR and 3D-content-creation capabilities, 
irrespective of their level of knowledge.
5.	
Gamification: We have a robust gamification 
component that helps all key stakeholders 
including leaders to create topical badges and 
provide a host of recognition and celebratory 
options for their teams. In addition, we have 
Lex, our versatile learning platform, helps our 
employees keep abreast of the latest technologies 
by facilitating learning anytime anywhere. Some of 
the key updates to the platform are:
1.	
Technology playgrounds and professional 
skills simulators: Infosys has leveraged 
cloud containers on a host of open-source 
technologies to create practical learning 
for our employees and give them hands-on 
experiences. We have over 180 technology 
playgrounds to enable learning through 
seamless experiences. In the last few months, 
gen AI-powered simulators have been a force 
multiplier for professional skill development. 
These simulators use a combination of 
animation and professional input to create 
different learning and teaching scenarios. In 
the current beta rollout, the gen AI professional 
skills simulators have been extended to 10,000 
employees.

Enabling digital talent at scale 
leveraged GenAI techniques to share the 
learning analytics of learners to present their 
learning data in an engaging story format. This 
personalized video service is available to the 
learners at key milestones and acts as a great 
motivator to review and realign their learning 
goals. 
6.	
Virtual learning assistant: The virtual learning 
assistant has been an integral part of the 
learning aid for our talent. With the help of 
GenAI, we have been able to give them a lot 
more flexibility to choose their own avatar, their 
learning style from Socrative to Adaptive to 
Storytelling and more, while also getting the 
option to translate terms and concepts in their 
native language.  
Other programs 
We have forged academic partnerships to develop 
future-ready top talent and to collaborate on 
emerging and niche technologies. We conducted 
various workshops in AWS, Azure, GCP and 
GenAI in collaboration with our partners to 
provide employees hands-on exposure to cloud 
technologies. Some of these interventions include 
Microsoft Copilot drives and Infosys ETA AI Academy 
track-led hands-on GenAI training for business 
leaders in India and Europe. 
A web version of the global news publication, Wall 
Street Journal, was launched via Lex for employees. 
Financial Times, which was introduced earlier, has 
over 1,00,000 users now.
‘Milestone’ programs for our mid-level employees to 
enhance their role readiness, peer networking and 
leadership connect, and ‘Bridge’ programs that offer 
employees training and internship opportunities 
to switch to new careers, such as consulting 
and technical architecture, have also seen wider 
participation.
Our learning efforts continued to garner accolades 
from Brandon Hall, ATD Best and Training Apex. 
Avasant, Everest and Nelson Hall continue to rate 
our digital learning capabilities in the highest 
quadrant.

Infosys in skilling efforts.
Community 
Infosys Springboard, India
Through Infosys Springboard India, we have 
garnered 
7.7 million learners, of which  
32% are women learners 
Our association with state governments and 
educational institutions has ensured we have access 
to the most remote towns where education is 
eagerly awaited. 
a.	 Maharashtra SCERT Engagement: In an 
engagement with primary and secondary 
teachers in Maharashtra with the help of the 
state education department, the content was 
developed in Marathi and ringfenced to the 
intended audience of over two lakh teachers. For 
the experience to be seamless and immersive, 
the Springboard platform offered Marathi, along 
with 23 native Indian languages, for navigation 
support. We have clocked over 2.97 million 
learning hours in this project, and we continue 
to engage learners.
The platform, powered by Infosys Wingspan, is 
available free of cost to any curious learner from 
Class 6 onwards. 
Immersive learning experiences together with 
a host of benefits, including curated world-class 
content through partnerships with top content 
providers like Coursera, Skillsoft, Techademy, 
and more, offer insights into various domain and 
technology trends through masterclasses by 
recognized academia and industry experts. Virtual 
practice environments include programming 
challenges and assessments.

b.	 Language flexibility: During our Catch Them 
Young pan-India sessions, we have seen 
language flexibility play a strong role. Translators 
are crucial in such sessions. For one of our Catch 
Them Young 2023 sessions, one of our Pune 
employees, Nilesh Shivaji Suryawanshi, set up 
a streaming facility in his village for all three 
days. He helped to translate and also helped the 
students speak up and engage with the trainers 
who joined from LBSNAA (Lal Bahadur Shastri 
National Academy of Administration), Mussoorie. 
Renowned authors had also joined in from 
Bengaluru. Language was no bar here.
c.	 Last-mile connectivity: When learners cannot 
make it to the classroom, we have found an 
interesting way of taking the classroom to the 
learners. Infosys Springboard Lab on Wheels 
is a mobile classroom in a bus, equipped 
with a trainer and STEM learning kits. This 
initiative helps us take learning to government 
schools in the remotest parts of the country. In 
areas where network connectivity proves to be a 
challenge, we leverage the Infosys Springboard 
Raspberry Pi device to provide content to 
learners. 
d.	 Community inclusion: In line with our inclusion 
efforts, our partnership with the Chamarajanagar 
district administration helped us engage with 
prison inmates for skilling and making them 
livelihood-ready. A computer lab has been set up 
in the prison and government schoolteachers in 
the vicinity have offered to teach the inmates.

Tech for good
At Infosys, we are going through a transformation journey to become AI-first and as part of this, we are weaving 
AI into all aspects of our business, including TechForGood. We are working on applying AI to solve societal 
problems in the areas of healthcare, e-governance, and education in a responsible manner.
SightConnect
Infosys' TechForGood initiative, in partnership with 
Infosys Foundation and LV Prasad Eye Institute, has 
designed and launched the SightConnect mobile 
application with the goal of making preventive 
eyecare accessible to everyone. The app can be used 
by patients or healthcare workers anytime, anywhere 
to test for eye conditions, diagnosis and further 
referral to specialists for in-person management 
of the case. It also enables remote communication 
between patients, healthcare workers, doctors, 
consultants, technicians, and eye banks.
•	
AI-powered triage: Using a series of questions 
and a visual acuity test, SightConnect generates 
a preliminary assessment of eye health, 
indicating whether an urgent or routine 
consultation is recommended. It has been tested 
successfully in clinical trials at LVPEI.
•	
Enhanced visual acuity test: To ensure accuracy 
during the self-assessment, the app utilizes AI 
to precisely locate facial landmarks in real time 
using the smartphone camera. By analysing the 
contours of the eyes, the app verifies if the user is 
testing the correct eye as instructed.
•	
Multilingual accessibility: It removes language 
barriers by offering automated translations 
for both the app text and the Interactive Voice 
Response (IVR) system. This is powered by the 
Ai4bharat IndicTrans2 (IT2) – Bhashini model.
Artificial intelligence is used for triaging, visual acuity 
test, accessibility across Indian languages, cataract, red 
eye detection and to determine the distance between 
the smartphone camera and the eye.
AI helps the app to precisely measure the distance 
between the smartphone camera and the user's 
eye. This is crucial during visual acuity tests, where 
factors like phone brightness, optotype size, 
and viewing distance – all impact accuracy. By 
determining the eye position using facial contours, 
the AI model allows us to calculate the optimal 
“distance to object” for the test.
•	
Cataract and red eye detection (clinical trials): 
SightConnect uses a specialized AI model to 
analyze eye images for potential signs of cataract 
and red eye. Clinical validation for this feature is 
under way.
Responsible By Design
To ensure that AI is used in a responsible 
manner, a Responsible AI framework is used in 
implementing and governing AI. The framework 
focuses on regulatory compliance, explainability, 
reproducibility, fairness and bias, safety, privacy, 
security, model validation, IP protection and 
infringement, sustainability, AI audits and standards, 
and governance.

Infosys Springboard
Since its launch in Brent in 2021, Springboard 
has seen tens of thousands of people sign up to 
the platform, positively impacting digital literacy 
and inclusion rates in the local area. The platform 
has helped residents of all ages upskill. The 
next phase of the rollout across Brent delivered 
continued access to digital skills training and 
mentorship for local businesses, helping SMEs 
unlock new opportunities to innovate and become 
digitally-enabled enterprises. The collaboration is 
underpinned with an aim to support the building 
of a robust workforce and bolster local economic 
growth via investment in digital skills.
In March 2024, Infosys announced a partnership 
with Sandwell Council to launch its Springboard 
digital learning platform in the region, making 
it available to Sandwell residents, colleges, and 
schools. Councillor Simon Hackett, Cabinet Member 
for Children and Education, Sandwell Council, said: 
"Springboard is a fantastic opportunity for Sandwell 
residents. The opportunity to work alongside 
a multi-national organization like Infosys, will 
equip our enterprises, such as schools, colleges 
and training providers, with the tools needed to 
increase digital accessibility and help achieve higher 
aspirations. It will also enable our residents to access 
a wealth of opportunities for future careers and gain 
greater prosperity for Sandwell".

Infosys Philippines donated food and supplies to 
250 families of the Aeta Community, goodies to 
children of the Tahanan ng Pagmamahal orphanage 
and contributed to the wellbeing of typhoon 
victims. Team Kalnfoscian (employee volunteers) 
celebrated the valentine season by contributing 
groceries, toys, school essentials, and clothes to the 
children at Tahanan ng Pagmamahal.
Employee volunteers partnered with Green Antz, an 
NGO specializing in eco-bricks and eco-pavers, for 
an eco-waste recycling project. They collected over 
207 kg of plastic, PET bottles, and cartons. A total of 
60 kg of plastic waste collected was repurposed into 
eco-bricks.
The Infosys Development Centre in the Philippines 
is actively partnering with women-led and 
indigenous-owned businesses for all supplies like 
coffee, client tokens, snacks, and cleaning products. 
They have supported more than 10 families in 
Kalinga, Apayao, who produce leis and placemats 
that are given to clients as tokens of appreciation.
Infosys is proud to launch a unique teacher training

Hackney School of Food
In September 2023, Infoscions spent the day 
volunteering at Hackney School of Food, a 
Community Interest Company whose mission is to 
educate primary schoolchildren about food and 
healthy eating. Despite its proximity to central 
London, 28% of children in Hackney live in poverty 
meaning that their families have an income less 
than £264 a week before housing costs have been 
deducted. Hackney has the fourth highest rate of 
child poverty in London. Since its launch in March 
2020, Hackney School of Food has helped over 
10,000 primary school-aged students. A team of 20 
Infoscions extended their support by maintaining 
the school’s teaching garden by weeding, hedging 
and composting – this garden is used to educate 
children about the providence of their food, 
ensuring that they make healthy nutritious choices 
for a better quality of life. 
Ukraine
Infosys is delighted to announce a new phase in our 
partnership with Street Child, an NGO that works 
to ensure that children across the world are safe, 
in school and learning. Education is a fundamental 
right but in a humanitarian crisis, education and 
learning continuity is underprioritized. Research 
shows that society is more likely to have peace, 
stability, and economic growth when education 
for children is properly invested in. Yet, in a 
humanitarian crisis, education is chronically 
underfunded with only 3% of global humanitarian 
funding allocated to learning.
The war in Ukraine has resulted in over 3,000 
schools and learning spaces in the country being 
damaged and 322 destroyed. While some schools 
are currently assessed as 'safe to open', many 
schools continue to remain closed. As a result, 30% 
of children have returned to in-class learning, while 
35% are engaged in a combination of in-class and 
remote learning, leaving 35% of students confined 
to remote learning alone.

Energizing local communities 
Infosys is supporting the pilot of two programs 
that integrate our Springboard learning platform to 
reach children, young people, and educators in this 
Education in Emergencies context. 
1.	
Digital Transformation Program:  
Infosys and Street Child will strengthen digital 
literacy among teachers in areas close to the 
contact line through Infosys Springboard. 
Teachers will be supported to acquire the 
capabilities and confidence to use Learning 
Management Systems and software, including 
e-cabinets and course constructors. They will be 
enabled to use skills such as problem-searching, 
strategizing, researching, and resolving, as 
per the priorities of the Ministry of Education 
and Science. As a specific skill, Street Child will 
support teachers to use adaptive and assistive 
instruments and technologies to adapt teaching 
to abilities, age, and gender, and to respond to 
interruptions to instructional time, including 
through power strikes and shortages. Street 
Child will empower 2,500 teachers in this way, in 
turn benefiting thousands of children.
2.	
Digital Learning Centres Program 
Street Child and Infosys are partnering to 
establish five safe and secure Digital Learning 
Centers (DLCs) in the oblast of Dnipropetrovsk 
and equip them with digital assets and devices 
in accordance with the DLC standards of 
the Education Cluster Sub-Sector on Digital 
Transformation. The DLCs will cater to children 
of all abilities, ages and genders and include 
accommodations for children with disabilities, 
allowing them to access individualized, 
interactive teaching and learning, and 
additional tutoring. The DLCs will substitute 
for schools in the immediate term and, in 
time, should schools re-open, the DLCs will be 
adapted to strengthen schools through the 
provision of capacity strengthening, coaching, 
and training for teachers and targeted, tailored 
tutoring for students using Infosys Springboard. 
The DLCs are expected to reach 7,500 children 
overall, or 2,500 children per year.
from various schools to tennis, integrating a STEM 
program powered by Infosys Springboard, designed 
to inspire the next generation and empower them 
with digital skills. 
Christmas Toy Drive
On Christmas eve, Infoscions from our French 
offices united to donate toys to Secours Populaire, 
a charity committed to supporting underprivileged 
children. Secours Populaire is a French non-profit 
organization dedicated to fighting poverty and 
discrimination in public life.
Netherlands
In the lead-up to Christmas, Infoscions were 
encouraged to donate toys to the Stichting Foor 
El Qaar, an organization in Amsterdam West 
which focuses on families living in deprivation. 
Amsterdam-based Infoscions further volunteered 
for the organization’s Winter Fusion Festival to 
assist with cooking meals and baking typical Dutch 
oliebollen, serving delicious hot chocolate milk, 
tea and coffee to get clients in the festive mood. In 
addition to this, volunteers supported by sorting 
clothes, toys and other items and handing these out 
in care packages.
Switzerland
Infosys was the headline sponsor of Street Child’s 
annual corporate fundraising event “The Big Ride” 
that was held in Thiel in 2023. Our sponsorship of 
the event was used for unrestricted funds, meaning 
that it was deployed across countries where Street 
Child has a presence including: the 'Democratic 
Republic of Congo'(DRC), Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra 
Leone, Liberia, Kenya, Uganda, Cameroon, and 
many other countries in the African continent. Our 
sponsorship also unlocked £1Mn of fundraising 
through the event to be similarly deployed in these 
environments. An Infosys delegation participated 
and rode over 200 km collectively in further support 
of the charity. 
At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Street Child 
and Infosys held an inspiring conversation on the 
importance of investing in education, and the role 
technology and innovation can play in helping 
children get back to learning after a crisis strikes. 
There are 222 million crisis-affected children and 
young people who need educational support; 78.2 
million children are out of school and 84% of these 
children are living in areas of protracted crisis such 
as Afghanistan, the DRC, Ethiopia, Pakistan, and 
Ukraine. The conflict in Ukraine has impacted 5.7 
million school-aged children to date. 
Panellists included Inderpreet Sawhney, Infosys 
Group General Counsel and Chief Compliance 
Officer, Adele Raz, the last Afghan ambassador to 
France 
Infosys CSR UK and Europe is now entering its 
second year of partnership with Les entreprises 
pour la Cité (LEPC). LEPC is a French non-profit 
organization whose mission is to amplify the 
societal impact of our partners, promote social 
innovation, and equal opportunities for all. 
We deepened our relationship to deliver their 
“Innov'Avenir” program through Springboard, 
enabling nationwide reach. The program targets 
young students from priority neighbourhoods, 
providing them with the skills needed to 
successfully navigate the digital changes in society 
and encourage their interest in digital careers and 
more largely their integration into the professional 
world. Through initiatives like the Hackathon in 
Toulouse and Marseille, we have seen the spark 
of technology ignite in 36 young adults. The 'Les 
Pros dans ta classe' program has also far exceeded 
expectations, reaching over 2,300 secondary school 
pupils and surpassing our initial target twofold. It's a 
story of ambition, commitment, and collective effort 
to broaden horizons and foster curiosity.

among young adults. A team comprising a social 
worker and an individual with personal experience 
visited the school to share their insights. The 
program's objective was to destigmatize mental 
health issues. Participants received comprehensive 
information about mental illnesses, how to identify 
them, and how to support and approach classmates 
facing mental health challenges.
Thanks to the generosity of our colleagues, we 
collected dozens of books, creating a diverse

was one of them and we hosted a booth and 
participated in the workshops on both days.
Costa Rica
Infosys Costa Rica donated 150 backpacks to 
Guachipelin School. With the belief of equipping 
students with the necessary tools to reach their 
full potential, the business enabling teams worked 
together with great enthusiasm to leverage existing 
resources for this activity. 
The weeklong collection of packed food items 
and clothes was donated to the Dormitorio de la 
Municipalidad de Sanjose. This contribution will be 
utilized by people recovering from drug addictions, 
prolonged medical ailments, and old homeless 
people living on the streets.
Puerto Rico
Infosys Puerto Rico donated supplies to schools that 
need assistance and aid. As part of environmental 
conservation activities at the center, a team of 
volunteers cleaned the areas around Crash Boat 
Beach in Aguadilla.
They collected and donated water, beverages, and 
snacks for the No Limits Basketball organization 
who provide basketball clinics to children with 
autism in the northwest side of Puerto Rico. 
Every year, employee volunteers in Infosys Puerto 
Rico support Samaritan’s Purse International Relief 
with their mission to provide gifts for children in 
need during the Holiday season. The donation 
boxes filled with toys, hygiene products, and school 
supplies brought smiles and joy to the children 
while fulfilling their essential needs.
The development center team also appreciated 
the participation of local vendors with handmade 
candles, jewelry, clothing, pet accessories, and 
baked goods.

Employee wellness and experience
Facilitating employee 
wellness and 
experience
Our purpose is to amplify human potential and 
create the next opportunity for people, business 
and communities. 
Our people are crucial to our purpose. To meet the 
challenges that our industry, our clients, and society 
face at large, we need people who will function at 
their best, creating and developing opportunities 
to move us all forward. Deeply tied to our purpose 
are principles that guide our behavior; we express 
those as C-Life: Client Value, Leadership by 
Example, Integrity and Transparency, Fairness and 
Excellence. These principles form the bedrock of all 
our endeavors and are deeply embedded in all our 
teams, upheld by leaders across the organization, 
and readily recognized by every colleague. We call 
our people “Infoscions” because they are not just 
employees but the true custodians of the culture, 
legacy, and purpose of Infosys worldwide. 
Our Employee Value Proposition aims to inspire 
and enable our employees to find purpose and 
make an indelible impact through meaningful work 
and passionate teams, ensure that our employees 
continuously learn and grow in their careers and 
shape our collective future, and create opportunities 
for every employee to navigate further, powered by 
our culture and partnered by other employees with 
shared aspirations.
The Manager Code is designed to enable and 
equip our managers with the capabilities to help 
their teams build technical, business and people 
skills along with a digital mindset to accelerate 
their development journeys. Managers have seven 
Manager Codes that act as guiding behavioral 
principles that shape a good manager at Infosys.  
As part of this initiative, we launched Manager Hub, 
a one-stop microsite for all information, toolkits and 
resources for managers to be equipped for their 
role.
Career growth and learning 
avenues 
Learning and career: Lex, our in-house learning 
platform continues to be a significant driver of 
talent development at Infosys and is integrated with 
internal systems to guide employees on their career 
journeys. With remote working firmly established, 
Lex has evolved to engage employees through 
hybrid learning models. In fiscal 2024, employees 
recorded 24 mn+ hours of learning.
Holistic skill building for career growth: For greater 
success of our talent in their current and future 
roles, we have outlined the various skills needed, 
including core foundational and social skills. 
A Digital Quotient (DQ) helps employees keep 
track of their digital skills. Those with a higher DQ 
have greater access to new opportunities and 
interesting projects. Further, with Career Canvas, 
employees can choose their aspired roles and be 
skill-ready for the current and next role through 
skill-based learning paths. Employees also have 
access to various roles and practical experience 
with new skills through short-term internal projects. 
The Accelerate platform that drives this allows job 
creators to publish independent job modules (with 
client approvals) that job-seeking colleagues can 
volunteer to execute. Both job creators and seekers 
are incentivized for work well done. In fiscal 2023, 
we launched iAIM, the aspiration management 
platform to capture employee aspirations. The 
framework is based on four key actions – Connect, 
Converse, Converge and Close. 
Bridge programs help employees develop new 
skills and shift to new careers that typically require 
different qualifications. 
An internal marketplace serves as a vehicle to 
match employees with opportunities to provide job 
rotation in work areas of their choice and capability. 
Performance management: The performance 
management framework focuses on deep 
engagement of key talent with regular 
conversations between managers and teams 
through check-ins facilitated by a contemporary 
tool. It also strengthens focus on development 
through career conversations and Integrated 
Development Plans (IDPs). 100% of eligible 
employees have received a performance appraisal 
in fiscal 2024. 
The platinum club is a niche experience created 
for our top performers. The program’s structure 
ensures that there are diverse career experiences 
and additional rewards for those who are identified 
as platinum club members. 
Our Employee Value Proposition continues to build on three pillars
Employee headcount: 3,17,240  
Pulse score: 80% 
Wellbeing rate: 91% 
Employees recruited locally: 90%  
Freshers hired: 11,900+

four key competencies to build future-readiness 
– business acumen, digital mindset, leading 
people, and operational excellence. The program 
is self-paced and is entirely in the e-learning mode 
comprising short management courses from 
eCornell. 
Infosys Leadership Institute 
Continuing its award-winning streak, the Infosys 
Leadership Institute (ILI) won the prestigious 
Society of Human Resources (SHRM) Excellence 
award for Developing Leaders of Tomorrow in 
fiscal 2024. This was accompanied by the highest 
internal recognition of the Infosys Award for 
Excellence for its IamtheFuture program focused 
on leadership diversity and Constellation program 
focused on strengthening the leadership succession 
pool. As a part of the Constellation program, the 
high-potential leaders continued to work on the 
organizational strategic projects, bolstered by a 
certificate program on Organizational Change 
Leadership from MIT. 
In addition to strengthening the succession 
pool through the Constellation program, there 
were specific programs designed to augment 
succession strength across the organization. With 
technology-led disruption becoming all pervasive, 
particularly driven by Generative AI, ILI curated a 
business-oriented certification program on AI by 
Kellogg. More than 400 leaders have enrolled in the 
program and this focus will continue in fiscal 2025. 
Leadership engagement and development continue 
to strengthen with about 95% of our leaders 
completing at least one significant leadership 
program this year, with more than 70% completing a 
certification program from an Ivy League Institution. 
Our leaders invested about 10,000 learning 
days equivalent to strengthen their leadership 
capabilities. The third phase of the highly-acclaimed 
IamtheFuture program commenced in fiscal 2024, 
with a focus on building higher-order organizational 
and leadership capabilities, culminating in projects 
designed for business impact. More than 500 
women leaders have completed various phases 
of this program, earning the ILI-Stanford GSB 
certificate. 
Return to office and  
hybrid model of work 
At Infosys, the future holds endless possibilities 
for us, and we are working towards creating a new 
equilibrium for work – in our offices and homes, 
and the hybrid model is being fine-tuned to fit 
seamlessly. It will transform under the three key 
paradigms – Work, Workforce and Workplace, 
catering to the three employee segments – Fully 
onsite working from office, fully remote with hybrid-
being the large majority. Our approach to return 
to work has been phased and balanced, with an 
equal focus on employee flexibility and business 
requirement.

Employee wellness and experience
Employee experience  
and engagement 
We strive to create a world-class employee 
experience by designing consistent best-in-class 
policies, processes, programs, and systems, focusing 
on creating ‘Experience by Design’ while keeping 
employees at the core of whatever we do. We 
gather employee feedback using robust listening 
mechanisms, built in through the employee life 
cycle to help improve our offerings and create 
positive memorable moments that matter using 
technology. Some of our interventions across the 
employee life cycle include: 
InfyMe: Our mobile-first, self-service platform that 
brings all services to our employees’ fingertips 
anytime, anywhere. InfyMe is designed to be 
intuitive and contextual and aids networking 
and collaboration. We continued to enrich our 
InfyMe app with more services that enable teams 
to operate, connect and collaborate easily and it 
is particularly effective in the hybrid work model. 
More than 200 touchpoints for activities have been 
merged into the intuitive interface of InfyMe. 
Moments That Matter (MTM): Every employee has 
significant moments that create substantial impact 
on their overall satisfaction and well-being, during 
their organizational experience. MTM has been 
ideated to become a celebration platform which 
will be integrated into all celebrations, small or big, 
throughout the employee life cycle. 
Petit Infoscion Day: A special celebration dedicated 
to the children of Infoscions serving as a dynamic 
showcase for a variety of talents, deeply embedding 
the culture and essence of being an Infoscion. Each 
year it unfolds around a unique theme, ensuring 
our Petit Infoscions enjoy a memorable day filled 
with fun games, activities, delicious treats, rewards, 
recognition and more. This year, we celebrated the 
day across 17 DCs on a single day with an impressive 
attendance of over 60,000+. 
Celebrating and  
rewarding excellence 
Celebrating excellence serves to inspire the entire 
workforce to continuously raise performance 
benchmarks and strive to reach greater heights. 
RISE our rewards and recognition program 
celebrates a performance-driven culture through 
leveraging an integrated digital platform for an 
elevated experience.
Gracias is an appreciation portal for employees to

followed by location-level ceremonies held at every

Employee care and connect 
Our wellness efforts are powered by the 
award-winning Infosys’ Health Assessment and 
Lifestyle Enrichment (HALE) program. HALE is a 
non-monetary employee benefit and has been 
recognized as the best internal brand with great 
recall and participation. Our wellness philosophy 
stands on the four pillars i.e. Physical, Emotional, 
Social well-being and Safety. Our interventions are 
co-created with extended teams, business units, 
and external partners and cater to the needs and 
asks of our employees. Our philosophy at HALE 
is a proactive approach to health and lifestyle 
enrichment aimed at increased awareness and 
overall well-being, resulting in reduced stress levels, 
a safe work environment, a happier workforce, and 
improved productivity levels. 
Resolution hubs (formerly the 
Internal Complaints Committee) 
Infosys is committed to providing a safe and positive 
work environment. In keeping with this philosophy, 
the organization envisages an open-door policy 
and encourages a culture of “speak up”. Employees 
also have access to several forums where they 
can highlight matters or concerns faced at the 
workplace for effective remediation. This is achieved 
through a well-established and robust grievance 
resolution mechanism comprising resolution hubs. 
Resolution hubs adhere to the principles of natural 
justice, confidentiality, sensitivity, non-retaliation, 
and fairness, while addressing concerns. The 
concerns are handled objectively while ensuring 
timely action and closure. In matters that entail a 
detailed investigation, the process ensures fairness 
for all. Read more here Resolution Hubs (infosys.

Employee satisfaction
Infosys has a robust mechanism to gauge employee 
sentiments and feedback called Pulse. Pulse 
collects ongoing and real-time feedback from 
employees anonymously on key organization-wide 
themes that shape an employee’s experience at 
Infosys such as work, learning and careers. We poll 
the entire organization through a micro survey 
every quarter. In addition to this, we also poll our 
employees on select tenure-based milestones and 
specific events including onboarding, job rotation, 
and appraisals. This cumulative understanding of 
employee perception, and feedback from actual 
events and milestones have strengthened our 
sensing architecture to obtain richer insights of 
employee experiences. To drive change across the 
organization, all managers have access to a real-time 
customized dashboard with feedback from their 
respective teams, which enable them to engage 
with their teams better and address any concerns. 
This dashboard has multiple views and advanced 
analytics such as heatmaps, trendlines, sentiment 
analytics to enable the managers to prioritize focus 
areas according to their teams. 
Infosys performance management puts equal 
focus on the future development of the employee 
and the introduction of Individual Development 
Plan (IDP) is a testament to the same. IDPs are 
created by employees under the guidance of 
the manager and are a perfect blend of theory 
and application. Managers coach and mentor 
the employee to set career and professional 
aspirations and reach them in a structured manner. 
Employees are also encouraged to take up training 
to upskill / reskill themselves to meet the needs 
of the projects. In case of continued lack of 
expected performance, employees are identified 
for a structured performance improvement 
plan where they are given goals and managers 
support them in achieving these goals. At the end 
of the performance cycle, employees receive a 
performance rating. To support the process, we 
have our web and mobile app called iCount, where 
employees can add their goals and are encouraged 
to update progress against the same on a regular 
basis. Managers can provide feedback to employees 
on these goals and support them in achieving 
the objectives. Feedback from client stakeholder 
(although not mandated by the process) is also a key 
input that the manager uses during performance 
and development conversations. Along with this, 
employees can seek and share feedback with all the 
colleagues they work with. Thus, iCount goes a long 
way in providing a holistic view of the employees' 
performance.
Human rights 
Infosys is a signatory to the UNGC. Our human rights 
stand is contained in our Code of Conduct and 
Ethics in an important tenet, ‘Respecting Each Other.’ 
The Infosys Human Rights Statement articulates 
our philosophy to provide a discrimination-free 
workplace for all employees and contractors. All our 
employees and contractors undergo a mandatory 
Smart Awareness Quiz (SAQ), every year, which 
includes questions on human rights and the 
Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics. The SAQ is a

Performance management
Over the years, Infosys has established a 
robust performance culture. Our performance 
management process drives a 'meritocracy 
culture' yet stays individual employee-focused and 
development-oriented. We focus on identifying the 
best performers against standards of performance 
instead of relative comparison of individuals. This 
mechanism helps us to identify our best performers 
through well-defined goals that are always relevant, 
continuous feedback and a strong focus on 
employee development. 
Aligning with this performance management 
philosophy, we have a defined performance 
review and assessment process. Continuous 
feedback is an essential element of the process 
with regular reviews, culminating in a ratings-
based holistic view of the employee’s performance. 
Performance conversations between employee 
and manager happens routinely, given the 
continuous performance process that we have in 
Infosys. The continuous feedback process helps 
managers to provide instant feedback for necessary 
improvements in work.

rights. The assessment protocol used leverages the 
Articles contained in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights (UDHR), ILO, UNGC Principles, the 
GRI Standards, the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) parameters, as 
well as Health and Safety criteria and environment

Security personnel: All our security personnel 
deployed on "owned premises" in India are 
trained on human rights related topics. The Infosys 
Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) has reference 
to human rights and it states, ‘Infosys expects its 
suppliers to support and respect the protection of 
internationally proclaimed human rights and to 
ensure that they are not complicit in human rights 
abuses.’ As part of the onboarding process, the 
vendors have to accept the SCoC.  The procurement 
team ensures that SCoC acceptance is done by 
vendors and maintains a tracker for the same. As on 
fiscal 2024, 328 supplier ESG assessments have been 
completed. Security Personnel include employees 
from 3rd party organization and are trained on 
human rights related topics.
Collective bargaining: The minimum notice period 
for significant operational changes are included 
in the collective bargaining agreements (CBA) 
wherever mandated by law. In countries where 
there is no such mandate to include them in the 
CBA or in countries where CBA is not mandated, we 
abide by the local laws prevailing in the land. In all 
other scenarios, Infosys prescribes the notice period 
based on the type of change.

Occupational Health  
and Safety
Infosys acknowledges that Occupational Health 
and Safety (OH&S) is one of the key aspects of 
sustainable business practices and hence OH&S is 
integrated into our ESG framework. OH&S policies, 
processes, and practices at Infosys promote physical, 
mental, and social well-being of employees in the 
workplace. We are conscious of the fact that OH&S 
considerations is a legal and ethical responsibility, 
and it is an area which directly impacts employee 
well-being, productivity, and business performance. 
We also recognize that OH&S is a fundamental 
human right and thus we strive to provide a safe 
and healthy work environment to our employees. 
The Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) 
Management System at Infosys termed ‘Ozone’ 
is driven by Management commitment, legal 
requirements, and expectations of our stakeholders. 
Ozone has not only enabled us to obtain assurance 
on the processes instituted through certifications 
but has also fostered a culture of safety and well-
being across the organization. We ensure adherence 
to all applicable regulations in all the regions we 
operate across the globe. It is our constant endeavor 
to enhance safe work practices and enable safe 
working conditions, and through this, we have been 
able to reduce the occurrence / recurrence / severity 
of occupational incidents thus reducing financial 
implications on direct and indirect costs, improving 
employee productivity and retention. We prioritize 
physical and emotional well-being of employees. 
We provide access to healthcare, mental health 
resources, and promote work-life balance.

Management System 
The robust Health and Safety Management system 
at Infosys has enabled us achieve certification to 
ISO 45001:2018 standards across all India locations, 
including Infosys Limited and its subsidiaries, 
in line with our HSE strategy. The management 
system is implemented across locations globally 
based on applicable legal requirements and 
internal benchmarks and are a part of our internal 
audit coverage. At the helm of our Health, Safety, 
Environment Management System (HSEMS) is our 
Chief Risk Officer. The effectiveness and adequacy 
of the HSE framework, its execution and HSE 
performance are evaluated through periodic 
management reviews. The internal-external issues 
and opportunities for the organizational context 
are identified. Interested parties (including all our 
stakeholders), their needs and expectations, our 
expectations, legal requirements, owners, and mode 
of communication are also documented.

Employee wellness and experience
Some of the elements of the management system 
are listed below:
a. HSE policy
Our Health, Safety and Environmental policy 
enunciates our philosophy and commitment 
towards management of key HSE aspect and has 
played a pivotal role in advancing our initiatives and 
realizing the intended outcomes on OH&S.
Link to HSE Policy
b. Risk management
Ozone is based on the Demings cycle and has 
a focused risk-based approach in identification 
and implementation of operational controls in 
line with hierarchy and effective mitigation of 
hazards. Risk assessment is proactively conducted 
to identify hazards for all existing / new / modified 
activities, processes, products or services and 
the implementation of measures to minimize or 
control impacts and monitor them in a structured 
manner. Risk assessment is proactively conducted 
on a yearly basis or at the beginning of a new 
process or activity. Reactive risk assessments 
are also carried out at least once every quarter. 
Hazardous conditions present are identified and 
prioritized for elimination and control. Once the 
identified hierarchy of controls are implemented, 
the document is revisited to assess the residual 
risks. A ranking is done based on the severity and 
probability of the risk. The Occupational Health 
and Safety (OH&S) hazards in the workplace are 
communicated to all concerned stakeholders 
who are also consulted when there are changes 
in operations. Relevant OH&S hazards are 
identified, and appropriate operational controls 
are implemented. During training, the hazards are 
shared along with directions on ways to reduce 
the risk. Employees are also consulted during 
development and review of policies and procedures 
to manage risks. Emergency response procedures 
for different scenarios are established and mock 
drills are conducted to evaluate our preparedness, 
response, and learnings. 
b. Incident management
Incidents which include near misses / potential 
hazards / accidents are reported through internal 
applications, supervisors, or mails. Root causes of 
incidents are identified, analyzed and appropriate 
corrective actions are taken to avoid recurrence 
or occurrence of incidents leading to injuries / 
losses. Refer ESG data book for Incident-related 
information.
c. Occupational Health and Safety 
(OH&S) Committees
OH&S Committees comprising cross‑functional 
teams are established at each of our campuses 
and offices. The Development Center Heads chair 
the safety committee meetings at their respective 
locations in India. In our overseas offices, these 
committees are formed based on the local 
legislations. The representation of employees in 
safety committees is 100%. The committee brings 
employees and management together in a non-
adversarial, cooperative effort to promote OH&S 
within the entire workplace. The committee ensures 
the establishment, implementation, maintenance, 
and continual improvement of processes needed 
for the elimination of hazards and minimization of 
risks. Contract workers are also an intrinsic part of 
the committee, which is one of the ways to ensure 
participation and consultation. 
d. Training and awareness 
At Infosys, the embedding of HSE culture in the 
organization is ensured through competency 
development. Training needs are identified 
based on the nature of jobs, which may have a 
significant impact on the environment or may 
pose occupational health and safety risks. Training 
includes awareness building, mock drills, classroom 
sessions and periodic demonstrations. HSEMS 
training is also a part of our employee induction 
program. To enable continuous learning, a HSE 
awareness module is available on Lex, our internal 
learning platform. Job-specific and generic trainings 
are conducted for contractual staff during induction 
and later through refresher training. ESG frameworks 
also highlight the importance of employee 
engagement and stakeholder communication. 
Companies should actively engage with employees, 
involve them in decision-making processes, and 
provide channels for them to voice their concerns 
and feedback. This includes regular communication 
on OHS policies, procedures, and performance, as 
well as providing avenues for workers to report 
incidents, near-misses, and suggestions for 
improvement. Trainings are conducted either in 
physical or virtual modes. 
e. Participation and consultation 
The engagement of employees in ensuring safe 
and healthy workplace is essential and this is 
enabled through the process of participation and 
consultation which includes employee / contract 
staff involvement in: 
•	
Development and review of policies and 
procedures for risk management. 
•	
Change management where this might 
affect workplace health and safety through 
management of change procedure. 
•	
Representation in health and safety matters 
through the Safety Committee. 
•	
Understanding the OH&S hazards in the 
workplace which are communicated to all 
concerned including contractors and visitors. 
•	
Health promotion programs including a Safety 
Week and Health Week are conducted annually.
•	
Incident reporting including potential hazards 
and participation in the process of identification 
and implementation of controls based on 
root cause analysis, avoiding the recurrence of 
incidents, and aiding in elimination of unsafe 
behavior and conditions.
•	
Emergency mock drills and reporting or 
identifying learnings which need to be addressed.

Safety interventions
We have always focused on building a culture of 
safety at Infosys. Individual responsibility for safety 
is always emphasized and safety in the workplace 
is accorded the highest priority. The safety systems 
that are in place includes work permits, trainings, 
Lock Out Tag Out (LOTO), safety inspections, audits, 
operational controls, and monitoring. Processes, 
guidelines, and work instructions are established at 
various levels addressing various aspects of safety 
involved in routine / non-routine activities of our 
operations. Policies have been established focusing 
on specific areas like women’s safety, lone working, 
transport, travel, construction, among others. 
Inspections, audits, observations from mock drills, 
risk assessments etc., enable identification of gaps, 
learnings, deviations, which depict hazards and risks 
and to address the same effectively appropriate 
operational controls are identified, implemented, 
and tracked.
Safety promotions
In an endeavor to continually enhance safety 
awareness and sensitize manpower, we organize 
various promotional activities across the year. 
Through this initiative, we focus on –
1.	
Knowledge enhancement  
Recognizing the limited effectiveness of 
theoretical safety learning, we have transitioned 
to experiential learning. These models facilitate 
practical, example-based instruction for our 
contract workmen.
2.	
Active participation 
This will improve safety and health outcomes, a 
more engaged and productive workforce, and a 
safer and healthier workplace for everyone.
Employees are educated on the adoption of 
safe and healthy work practices through regular 
communication, trainings and interventions on 
key issues related to occupational health and 
safety hazards. In compliance with the regulatory 
requirements, robust reporting processes including 
reporting on occupational health issues have been 
adopted so that corrective actions can be taken, and 
preventive measures are implemented.
We conduct interventions at locations based on 
National and International days. During the year the 
following days were observed:
a. World Day for Safety and 
Health at Work (Global)
1.	
Awareness sessions were arranged across 
locations.
2.	
Employee engagements programs such as Spot 
the Hazard Contest, Poster with Slogan Contest, 
OSH Quiz Contest were conducted.
3.	
Creation and display of posters within the work 
premises.
4.	
Communication through mailers to spread 
awareness.
b. “National Safety Week” (India)
In fiscal 2024, the theme of the Safety Month held 
in March was “Focus on Safety Leadership for ESG 
Excellence”. Various employee engagement activities 
were conducted to enhance awareness on HSE such 
as: 
1.	
Communication and endorsement of the safety 
pledge by employees. 
2.	
Quiz competitions designed to test the 
knowledge of employees about safety measures 
and to create awareness on safety practices.

Occupational health
We focus on the holistic well-being of our 
employees which is ensured through safe and 
healthy work environment. 
a.	 Medical services 
We have established first aid centers on our 
campuses in India. Some of the first aid facilities 
operate on a 24*7-hour basis. The intent is to 
provide immediate attention to employees 
during emergencies and guide them to 
hospitals as may be required. Our telemedicine 
portal continues to operate enabling employees 
to consult our occupational health center 
doctors online, in India. The consultation 
records were automated during the year. 
We also have tied up with various hospitals 
to attend to emergencies. Large campuses 
have fully equipped ambulances ready for 
use and where required we may call upon 
the generic ambulance services. We provided 
wheelchairs and stretchers across campuses 
for emergency use. In overseas locations, we 
work with local service providers for enabling 
health services and with the local authorities as 
regulated by the law of the land. Trained first aid 
representatives are available across campuses 
as well. 
b.	 Health Risk Assessment (HRA) 
HRA is carried out annually based on inputs 
from the Occupational Health Centre (OHC). 
The hazard identification and risk assessment is 
also reviewed to identify hazards and work on 
elimination of any such factor that may affect 
employees’ overall health. Being an IT / ITES 
company, there are no product risks at Infosys, 
but the risks which are prevalent include 
ergonomics related conditions, musculo skeletal 
disorders (MSDs), emotional well-being, etc., 
associated with workplace, operation of utilities, 
commute. Numerous initiatives, interventions,

Employee wellness and experience
engagements, virtual sessions, and process 
controls are in place to address these risks. 
Identified employees who are eligible as per 
the local regulations will undergo medical 
check-up before joining. Annual periodic 
check-ups ensure good health and wellbeing 
of our employees.  An annual health check-
up covering lifestyle risks and hazards due to 
occupation is mandatorily conducted for all 
identified employees. 
c.	 Programs on ergonomics 
We make continuous ergonomic improvements 
to our work environment to ensure the wellness 
and comfort of our employees.
Onsite physiotherapy centers: We have 
physiotherapy centers in our large campuses 
in India to consult, treat, provide rehabilitation 
services, establish exercise regimens to our 
employees through physiotherapists covering 
ergonomics / MSDs. Occupational ergonomics 
cases are reported, and appropriate treatment 
is provided.
1.	
Interventions by ergonomic experts:  
The physiotherapists conduct virtual 
awareness sessions focusing on issues 
like back care, Repetitive Strain Injuries 
(RSI), postures at work etc. In India, 
physiotherapists have scheduled huddles 
with employees on the floor to give them 
tips on adjustments they can make in their 
workstations to match ergonomically right 
requirements. During the year, there were 
133 sessions conducted on ergonomics 
and back care, covering 7,807 participants 
globally.
2.	
Ergonomic infrastructure: Workstations and 
furniture are designed and procured after 
considering their ergonomic advantages. 
We have also taken care to procure systems 
which have inbuilt features that help avoid 
glare and hence reduce such instances. 
Workstation assessments are conducted to 
identify and provide aid to employees to 
improve the ergonomics of their workspace.
d.	 Physical and emotional wellbeing
Various interventions on physical and emotional 
well-being were enabled under the aegis of our 
Health Assessment and Lifestyle Enrichment (HALE) 
/ Secure Affirmative Fun Environment (SAFE) 
initiatives during the year. 
e.	 Healthy Eating and Active Living (HEAL)
Considering the low average age of employees 
at Infosys and to ensure they are healthy and 
devoid of lifestyle illnesses, there are focused 
interventions. In our campuses in India, we have 
deployed dieticians who provide the following 
services:
•	
Consultation
•	
Counselling 
•	
Menu engineering for food being supplied in 
food courts covering options and portions. 
We urge employees to develop healthy eating 
habits through enhanced communication. We 
have enabled vendors to supply healthy food 
options in our food courts.
We have created state-of-the-art gymnasiums 
to enable workouts. Yoga, aerobics, and 
swimming are available too. Recreation facilities 
in our campus includes badminton, tennis, 
snooker, cricket, basketball, bowling etc., 
to enable employees to engage in physical 
activities and keep themselves  fit. 
f.	 Programs for mothers
Infosys provides an inclusive environment 
and expectant mothers are also taken care 
of. As most campuses are huge, we enable 
transportation of such personnel to their 
buildings from the bus bay. During evacuations, 
care is taken that expectant mothers are 
separately evacuated to identified safe 
assembly points and are always escorted to 
ensure their safety. “Pregna Care”, a professional 
healthcare program is designed especially 
for expectant mothers and aims to provide 
maximum comfort to the mother. To ensure 
the health and wellbeing of the mothers and to 
avoid discomfort during this time, it is essential 
that proper exercises are part of their everyday 
routine. This program is implemented across a 
few locations in India and comprises: 
•	
Lifestyle suggestions during pregnancy
•	
Nutrition
•	
Discussion on common discomfort
•	
Problems during pregnancy
•	
Exercises designed for pregnant women
•	
Post-natal advice
Behavior-Based Safety (BBS) programs include 
BBS observation for contract staff, periodic 
inspections, trainings, observations from mock 
drills, and employee engagement programs. 
Work environment 
improvement
a.	 Indoor air quality 
At Infosys, we pride ourselves on going above 
and beyond Health and Safety Standards 
and Industry guidelines in maintaining 
Indoor Air Quality (IAQ). We have undertaken 
comprehensive evaluations of our HVAC 
infrastructure and have implemented 
modifications accordingly, all aimed at 
providing our employees with the best level 
of air quality possible. We are committed to 
providing our employees with the best IAQ, 
and we are confident that our efforts will 
ensure a safe, healthy, and comfortable working 
environment for everyone. 
Indoor air quality is monitored at all working 
locations to ensure clean and hygienic air 
is supplied, which improves cognition and 
productivity, reduces the spread of other 
airborne diseases, protects against outdoor air 
pollutants. Monitoring is done in two ways:
1.	
Real-time monitoring – Key parameters 
such as carbon dioxide (CO2), PM2.5, PM10 
are continuously monitored and connected 
to the building management system (BMS) 
in most buildings.
2.	
Third-party monitoring – Around 12 
parameters are monitored at defined 
frequencies annually as per ASHRAE / OSHA 
requirements.
b.	 Lux levels and noise levels 
These levels are maintained as per the standards 
for every work location and monitored 
annually to ensure that workplaces are made 
comfortable for employees, reducing eyestrain, 
headaches, hearing loss, and drowsiness. These 
lead to employee satisfaction and wellbeing.
c.	 Promoting green seal chemicals 
We are mindful of ensuring safety in the use 
of chemicals in our housekeeping and utilities 
processes. We conduct assessments of the 
impact of legal regulations and pre-inspections 
of chemical substances prior to procurement of 
chemicals. All tasks are assessed in advance for 
any potential risks and attempts to explore safer 
alternatives with applied hierarchy of onsite 
safety management levels.

the entities / bodies with which the Company has 
a conflict of interest. The same is addressed in 
accordance with policies of the Company. 
We have a structured governance mechanism to 
communicate critical concerns of stakeholders to 
the highest governing body, for review and due 
action. A multi-layer governance structure is in 
place to monitor and report risk and risk mitigation 
activities, including those of ESG. 
Our Enterprise Risk Management framework 
encompasses all the Company’s risks – strategy 
and strategy execution; operational; and legal and 
compliance risks. Any of these categories can have 
internal or external dimensions.The systematic and 
proactive identification of risks, and mitigation 
thereof, enables our organization to boost 
performance with effective and timely decision-
making. Strategic decisions are taken after careful 
consideration of primary risks, secondary risks, 
consequential risks and residual risks.
The risk management committee assists the Board 
in fulfilling its corporate governance oversight 
responsibilities with regard to the identification, 
evaluation and mitigation of strategic, operational, 
and external environment risks. A robust complaints 
management system ensures that all complaints are 
addressed effectively.  Read more
Stakeholder engagement is delegated to identified 
heads of departments and feedback from these 
engagements are discussed through a review of 
performance on our ESG ambitions as a part of the 
quarterly ESG Committee meetings. 
Our grievance redressal mechanisms are articulated 
in the Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics including 
a Whistleblower mechanism with non-retaliatory 
clauses for all stakeholders. Additionally, employees 
and contractual staff have access to robust 
resolution hubs. Suppliers are advised of grievance 
redressal mechanisms through the Supplier Code of 
Conduct which they mandatorily sign.
The ESG Committee reviews client engagements 
relating to climate action and sustainability efforts 
through the Company’s sustainability offerings and 
solutions. It also reviews compliance with climate 
change regulations across various jurisdictions, 
applicable to the Company.
Interaction with  
other Board committees
The ESG Committee works closely with other 
Board committees to further our ESG ambitions. 
For instance, it informs ESG risks and challenges, if 
any, in achieving progress on the goals, to the Risk 
Management Committee and seeks its support to 
address the risks.
It interacts with the Stakeholder’s Relationship 
Committee to discuss performance on ESG 
assessments and actions for improvements related 
to the Company’s ESG performance from the 
security-holder’s perspective. 
It collaborates with the CSR Committee to align CSR 
initiatives with ESG ambitions. 
It also interacts with the Cybersecurity Risk Sub-
committee as part of its efforts to track progress on 
the information security and data privacy ambitions. 
In addition to the ESG Committee, other Board 
committees and senior management are also 
actively involved in enhancing our performance 
and disclosures on a range of ESG topics relating 
to our different stakeholder groups. Specific cases 
of acquisitions, important managerial decisions, 
material positive / negative developments and 
statutory matters are presented to the committees 
of the Board and later, with the recommendation of 
the committees, to the Board for its approval.  
Refer to Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24. 
ESG performance evaluation 
ESG goals are a part of the corporate scorecard 
and the ESG performance parameters of leaders 
are cascaded to various levels in the organization. 
ESG performance of the Company is linked to the 
compensation of the CEO & MD and other leaders. 
CGR Remuneration to Directors in fiscal 2024

Building sustainable 
and responsible  
supply chains 
Our upstream value chain consists of more than 
6,000 suppliers across three categories – suppliers 
of people, suppliers of products and suppliers 
of services. Supplier relationships include long-
term, short-term, contractual, and project-based 
relationships. We have 871 MSMEs in our supplier 
base and in fiscal 2024, our procurement from 
MSMEs amounted to more than ` 2,300 crore.
For more information, read Business Consulting 
Services and Technology Services offered at Infosys.
Infosys believes in and is committed to partnering 
with the highest quality suppliers to ensure that 
we deliver best-of-breed business and IT solutions 
to our clients. As a signatory to the United Nations 
Global Compact (UNGC), Infosys leverages the 
UNGC principles covering human rights, labor, 
environment, and anti-corruption as foundational 
principles for building and improving its sustainable 
supply chain practices. The Company’s Responsible 
Supply Chain and Supplier Diversity Policy is an 
expression of our commitment to integrate these 
principles into our supply chain relationships and 
towards building long-term environmental, social, 
and economic opportunities for diverse businesses. 
This commitment is manifested in our internal 
activities and processes, as well as through the 
organizations we engage with externally. Integrity 
and ethics govern all our supplier partnerships, 
while also supporting and encouraging the 
aspirations of diverse businesses.
Infosys Supplier  
Code of Conduct
Infosys is proud of the way it conducts its business 
and has always been a company with a strong 
commitment to ethical business practices and 
sustainability. We encourages our suppliers to join 
in this commitment, based on a shared set of values 
and principles. We pursue mutually beneficial 
relationships with our suppliers and seek to work 
with businesses that are committed to act fairly and 
with integrity towards their stakeholders, observing 
the applicable rules of law. The Supplier Code of 
Conduct (SCoC) draws inspiration from the Infosys 
Code of Conduct and Ethics and the principles 
of the UNGC. It provides a detailed account of 
material topics that we are focused on to nurture 
and sustain responsible supply chains. As part of 
the onboarding process, all vendors must accept 
the Infosys SCoC. This is tracked diligently by the 
procurement team. Violations to the Supplier Code, 
can be reported through http://oic.infosys.com 
and the Infosys Helpline numbers, whistleblower@
infosys.com and vendorincident@infosys.com. There 
were no supplier complaints in fiscal 2024.
Screening before 
empanelment 
As part of the pre-contract and evaluation, we 
perform exhaustive due screening of suppliers in 
sanctions, corruption, financial crimes, litigations, 
and ESG at the time of onboarding with the help 
of a third-party tool. This assessment covers 
compliance, adverse media, information security, 
physical security, and sustainability, based on the 
type of vendor. We onboarded 2,404 new suppliers 
in fiscal 2024. Additionally, we have incorporated 
ESG criteria into the supplier onboarding process.  
We have incorporated ESG screening criteria for 
vendors onboarded through the online mode. 
During the fiscal year, 887 suppliers were onboarded 
online, and 68.4% of these suppliers were screened 
using a third-party tool. 
Local procurement
Our centralized procurements are in India, but we 
engage with local suppliers for local needs across 
geographies. We track and report diverse spends 
and make this information available to our clients 
on request. The proportion of spending on local 
suppliers (in India) was about 25+% in fiscal 2024.  
We did not have any significant actual and potential 
negative environmental and social impacts in the 
supply chain. In fiscal 2024, we expanded our India 
operations to Kolkata, Noida, Coimbatore, and 
Visakhapatnam.

Climate Change in this ESG Report.
Decarbonizing  
the supply chain 
Infosys has been a leader in climate action for many 
years due to its bold action in mitigating climate 
change impacts. Our ambitious ESG Vision 2030 and 
signing of The Climate Pledge aiming to be net zero 
by 2040 are important actions in this endeavor. We 
have been disclosing environmental information 
through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) since 
2006 and remain on CDP's leadership quadrant 
for the eighth year in a row. Our Science Based 
Target Initiative (SBTi) endeavors to reduce our 
environmental impact, mitigate risk and, promote 
environmental stewardship in our operations, 
including our supply chains. To meet these 
ambitious goals, Infosys expects its supply chain 
partners to align with the Company’s environmental 
vision and ambitions. To support our suppliers' 
efforts for early adoption, we organized in-person 
four training sessions for suppliers representing 
a large part of our capex in fiscal 2024 on climate

Deepening our responsible 
supply chain commitment
In fiscal 2024, we onboarded a third-party managed 
services provider to help assess our suppliers and 
guide their efforts in incorporating responsible 
business practices in their organizations. This 
program includes supplier assessments on a 
globally consistent framework along with industry 
benchmarks, supplier self-assessments through a 
questionnaire-led approach and capacity-building 
programs. This effort is expected to enable us to

Corporate governance
Integrity and compliance 
The Ethics and Compliance Program at Infosys has two key objectives – to uphold and ensure the values of 
integrity and transparency and to assure enterprise-wide regulatory compliance.
Integrity is key to nurturing a responsible business. Beyond regulation and stakeholder attention, there is a 
growing recognition that good behavior is good for business. At Infosys, our commitment to a value-based 
ethos is enshrined in our Code of Conduct and Ethics.
Our values are the principles we use to run the Company daily and are the source of our Code of Conduct and 
Ethics. Our values are the foundation of everything we do and are encapsulated in the acronym C-LIFE (Client 
value, Leadership by example, Integrity and transparency, Fairness and Excellence).
Code of Conduct and Ethics 
We firmly believe that following the highest 
standards of business conduct and ethics helps us 
run our business responsibly. Our Code of Conduct 
and Ethics ("the Code") helps us maintain the 
highest ethical standards for our employees.
It complies with the legal requirements of 
applicable laws and regulations, including anti-
bribery and anti-corruption and ethical handling of 
conflicts of interest. It also highlights expectations 
from our employees. The Code is signed off by the 
Board and the Office of Integrity and Compliance 
is the custodian of the Code. Our business partners 
acknowledge and comply with the Supplier Code of 
Conduct.
Purpose statement
The Code now encapsulates our purpose statement:
“To amplify human potential  
and create the next opportunity for  
people, businesses and communities.”
#SwipeRightforIntegrity 
#SwipeRightforIntegrity is an annual legal and 
compliance event organized by Infosys. The event 
brings together our leaders to reinforce our values 
of integrity, transparency, and good governance 
to build enduring relationships with our clients, 
employees, and partners. It has become a platform 
to create awareness and have an engaging dialogue 
with all stakeholders, and influence behavior and 
showcase the Infosys culture. This has taken forward 
the compliance and ethics program and created 
increased awareness of expected behavior .
Local Compliance Officer 
program 
To further raise awareness among our employees 
about ethical aspects globally, a Local Compliance 
Officer (LCO) network has also been created across 
the Infosys Group in collaboration with Office of 
Integrity and Compliance. The LCO network plays a 
crucial role, in promoting an organizational culture 
that encourages ethical conduct and a commitment 
to compliance with the law, regulations, and policies 
and helps in maximizing the impact of ethics-related 
communication and training.
Statutory and regulatory  
compliance practice
Infosys has implemented a statutory compliance 
program covering a wide swathe of business 
enabling areas, covering units across the global 
locations. This program has ensured that entities 
set up, irrespective of the geography follow the 
law of the land not just during the initial set up 
of the unit but also while employing resources 
with their attendant payroll, social security, etc., 
remittance of the tax appropriate with the entity 
structure, ensuring local facilities are compliant 
with the prevailing regulations, global movement 
of professionals is executed within the remit of the 
law, obligations on topics around Cybersecurity, 
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption, Anti-Trust, etc. 
are not just given due importance but are tracked, 
implemented and monitored on a regular basis. The 
program is monitored on a regular basis keeping 
pace with the growth of the organization globally.
In addition, Infosys set up a regulatory compliance 
program to centralize, track and monitor the 
implementation of compliances stemming from 
client engagements. Industry vertical compliances 
across eight verticals have been scoped, 
implemented, monitored for effectiveness topped 
up with an overview of new compliances on the 
horizon. The program set up with the assistance of 
an industry-leading consulting firm ensured that 
Infosys complies with all the applicable laws and 
regulations ensuring adequate governance across 
the industry spectrum. In the next phase, Infosys 
plans to initiate coverage on additional verticals 
and countries increasing the scope of the program. 
Infosys BPM is also scheduled to be covered as part 
of the regulatory compliance program ensuring 
adequate governance not just across Infosys but its 
subsidiaries as well. 
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption 
(ABAC) practices and policy
Our ABAC practices and policy is reviewed by the 
Management at regular intervals. 
With an evolving landscape, Infosys is committed 
to a responsible ABAC risk management framework 
to demonstrate a comprehensive risk management 
program to reduce the risks by regularly assessing 
risk in alignment with its growth strategies, and 
to drive an ethical and risk intelligent culture, to 
increase the certainty of business outcomes.
Risk assessment for bribery and corruption is done 
periodically and the criteria used include business 
units / internal departments, location, and the 
Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of countries, 
among others.
Reinforcing a culture of Compliance 
Digital version of the Code 
We also have a digital version of the Code. It offers 
a user-friendly and easy-to-navigate audio-visual 
experiences that also allows access to specific topics 
in an interactive manner. The Code can be accessed 
on mobile devices as well. The digital version of the 
Code aims to help every employee understand the 
behavior we expect and the principles and values 
we uphold. We aim to continue to build a culture of 
compliance, where everyone feels they can do the 
right thing and prioritize legal and ethical choices. 
The digital version of the Code is available here.
Training on the Code
Our employees and the Board members are 
trained on the Code. We have a Smart Awareness 
Quiz (SAQ), which includes training modules that 
employees are mandatorily required to undertake 
every year to renew their commitment to the Code. 
Our vendor partners were also trained on the 
Supplier Code of Conduct through various channels 
including live sessions during the vendor partner 
meet called Sambandh. We also have a detailed 
communication plan to use multiple channels of 
communication like emails, video messages, blogs, 
gamified assessments, and storyboards to spread 
awareness about various policies .

Anti-competitive practices policy 
The Anti-Trust Policy states the objective, scope, 
applicability, and regulatory consequences. This 
policy encompasses the three aspects of anti-
trust law bordering on: (i) abuse of dominance; 
(ii) anti- trust; (iii) merger control. The policy is 
reviewed periodically by the Management for its 
appropriateness and applicability. In addition to the 
policy being setup, training is provided at regular 
intervals to colleagues and / or teams which form 
part of the high-risk group for better awareness.
Export control policy 
The export control policy describes Infosys’ export 
control program and is reviewed periodically by the 
Management. The export control program protects 
the Company and its employees from potential 
risk of violation of sanctions prescribed under 
export control regulations and facilitates business 
expansion in accordance with these regulations. All 
our customers and vendors are screened against 
various sanctions to ensure that we are compliant. 
As part of the program, training modules, and 
awareness campaigns are rolled out to relevant 
employees to ensure that they are aware and are 
compliant with export control laws. 
We have a self-assessment and certification program 
in place for anti-bribery and anti-corruption, anti-
trust / anti-competition, and export control. 
Whistleblower policy
The Infosys Whistleblower Policy is a comprehensive 
and well-designed mechanism that encourages 
employees, vendors, customers, and any other 
stakeholders to report any unethical conduct, 
violation of applicable laws or the Company’s 
Code of Conduct and Ethics occurring within the 
Company. With strict confidentiality measures and 
multiple reporting channels, the policy ensures 
that whistleblowers are protected from any 
retaliation. The Company reviews all complaints 
impartially and takes appropriate action, as 
applicable, while providing regular communication 
to ensure awareness about the policy. The 
Infosys Whistleblower Policy is a testament to 
the Company’s commitment to transparency, 
accountability, and responsible corporate 
citizenship.
Use of technology for effective 
compliance monitoring of controls 
We have leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
Machine Learning (ML) technology to review and 
identify exceptions in compliance and Anti-Bribery 
and Anti-Corruption controls.
Compliance proof-testing
Infosys implemented a statutory compliance 
program covering 80 countries and 14 regulatory 
areas across major business enabling functions 
in September 2018. The program instituted a 
self-assessment of the compliance status against 
a compliance framework with a maker checker 
process built into it alongside enabling the creation 
of a repository of compliance proofs against self-
assessment.
Through aggregating compliance proofs across 
countries and regulatory areas, Infosys designed 
an OCR-based technology to scan the proofs and 
validate if the proofs corroborate the compliance 
status.
The technology was further leveraged to combine 
it with a rule engine testing compliance control 
around timeliness and accuracy of the compliance 
proof uploaded.
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption 
(ABAC) program
Infosys develops and manages multiple office 
facilities and collaborates with multiple vendors 
/ service providers during various phases of 
construction. Infosys engages with vendors for 
infrastructure development, facility maintenance 
and physical security. Sometimes, services to be 
obtained include permits, licenses, approvals, 
marketing activities / expenses, awareness 
campaigns and liaising with the authorities for 
filings and reporting requirements.
Infosys has implemented controls in procurement 
systems to ensure appropriate proof of service 
by vendors is submitted, reviewed, and approved 
before payments are released. The systems also 
monitor the process of requisitioning, purchasing, 
receiving, paying, and accounting for goods 
and services, from the point of order through to 
payment. These are the controls implemented, by 
reimaginging system logic and using AI and ML 
techniques:
•	
Traceability of transactions at initial procurement 
stages through user declaration and OCR 
technology.
•	
Trail of documentation to substantiate various 
milestones and proofs of services availed.
•	
Built-in escalation matrix to ensure timely 
approval of red flags identified for appropriate 
resolution and action.
•	
Tracking of potential red flag indicators through 
keyword searches and OCR technology before 
raising procurement request and payment 
processing.
•	
Periodic assessments of transactions on sample 
basis considering factors such as high-risk 
vendors / transactions.
In addition, digitized self-assessment and 
certification is also rolled out as part of monitoring 
and controls.

Grievance redressal 
Our grievance redressal mechanisms are articulated 
in the Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics including 
a Whistleblower mechanism with non-retaliatory 
clauses for all stakeholders. 
Additionally, employees and contractual staff 
have access to robust resolution hubs. Suppliers 
are advised of grievance redressal mechanisms 
through the Supplier Code of Conduct which they 
mandatorily sign. 
Employees, as important stakeholders, provide their 
feedback on a variety of topics on engagement 
through the periodic pulse survey. This offers 
them an opportunity to share feedback on the 
design, review and improvements to grievance 
mechanisms.  Infosys is committed to providing a 
safe and positive work environment. Employees 
also have access to forums where they can highlight 
matters or concerns faced at the workplace. This is 
achieved through grievance resolution mechanism

including more people in our vision so we can drive 
value together, while at the same time, fostering 
social impact, promoting stakeholder engagement, 
emphasizing ethical governance, and unlocking 
investment and market opportunities. This is 
encapsulated in our purpose statement – to amplify 
human potential and create the next opportunity 
for people, businesses, and communities. We

Data privacy
Evolving notion of privacy
Today, there is a much greater adoption of digital and emerging technologies in everything we do. The 
increased adoption of tools and technologies that we use at work have brought in a great deal of operational 
ease and efficiency, making life much simpler but at the same time, digital data processed as part of adoption 
of these tools and technologies is prone to data privacy threats and data leakages due to ease of information 
dissemination. This has led the authorities across the world to enforce stricter DP regulations demanding 
greater accountability from organizations, to ensure that the controls are not intrusive when deployed. At 
Infosys, the Data Privacy Office (DPO) an independent function, ensures right balance careful balancing before 
deploying them.
With AI evolving at rapid pace, various existing privacy laws already regulate AI systems to a considerable 
extent in applications processing personal information. Principles of AI like transparency, fairness and non-
discrimination, explainability and human oversight are related to specific individual rights and provisions of 
corresponding privacy laws.
Approach to sustained DP 
compliance
Infosys established its independent Data Privacy 
function over a decade ago. Reporting directly 
to the Management, this function leverages the 
globally-recognized PIMS (Privacy Information 
Management System) framework. Through fiscal 
2024, we ensured compliance with applicable DP 
regulations for all business enabling processes and 
applications, as well as client project execution.  
DP governance framework 
At Infosys, the Data Privacy Office plays the 
role of architect and checker, while business 
enabling functions and units are the makers, with 
independent audits being carried out periodically 
by our Quality team and external bodies. Quarterly 
senior management reviews ensure adequate 
oversight.

Aspirations in data privacy 
We make every effort to protect the personal 
information that comes under our purview. Our 
data privacy compliance framework is based on 
ISO 27701 with inputs that include convergence 
of international best practices, client-prescribed 
requirements, and applicable data privacy 
regulations across geographies. 
Adopting internationally 
accepted protocols 
We are among the first few organizations globally, 
to have our framework certified with accreditation, 
for ISO 27701 privacy information management 
standard. The coverage for this certification is being 
enhanced across Infosys centers worldwide in a 
phased manner.
The EPIC program
Anticipating the need to make privacy an integral 
part of any process or application dealing with 
personal data, an organization-wide strategic 
initiative named EPIC (Embedding Privacy by design 
into Infosys Culture) was rolled out in early 2022 
by the Data Privacy Office in collaboration with 
quality and delivery functions. EPIC is a framework 
for embedding privacy in the architecture and 
design stage itself and then throughout the 
software development lifecycle while designing and 
developing digital solutions. 
This EPIC program focuses on enabling the 
software development community at Infosys to 
engineer the 7 Privacy by Design principles into 
their software development process using privacy 
design strategies, design patterns and PETs (Privacy 
Enhancing Technologies). 
Vendor DP guidelines 
Vendor data privacy management of our extended 
entities has assumed strategic significance in the 
current scenario of third-party risks, given the 
increasing volume of data breaches, and enterprise 
dependency on outsourcing including cloud service 
providers. Suppliers present difficult and unique 
privacy and cybersecurity challenges. Compliance 
with diverse data protection laws across the world 
requires an effective mechanism for managing 
supplier-related risks to Infosys. We have published 
comprehensive guidelines for suppliers / vendors 
to ensure that they adhere to strict obligations 
imposed by contracts and applicable laws of the 
land, during their engagement with Infosys and its 
subsidiaries. The Infosys Supplier Code of Conduct 
is mandated across all essential suppliers involved 
in processing of personal data, along with necessary 
data processing clauses that are consented to 
prior to their onboarding. Assurance is further 
demonstrated through due diligence and annual 
assessments.
Our Data Privacy Policy, published on the company 
intranet, clearly demonstrates the top management 
commitment to DP across all Infosys operations, 
including those involving service providers. To 
ensure complete transparency, we provide privacy 
notices at the point of data collection for both 
internal and external data subjects. Additionally, 
the privacy statement for external data subjects is 
readily available on the Infosys website. All privacy 
notices and statements are regularly updated to 
reflect any changes in personal data processing or 
applicable data protection regulations. Personal

Data privacy
Incident and breach 
management 
Infosys has implemented robust mechanisms 
to detect, assess, contain, and manage data 
privacy incidents and breaches, with well-defined 
processes and procedures to respond to them 
within defined timelines in accordance with the 
laws of the land. We have a dedicated team of data 
privacy professionals who oversee the incident 
management process and coordinate with the 
relevant stakeholders, such as the business units, 
the information security team, the legal team, the 
communications team, and the external service 
providers. We also have a network of data privacy 
champions and coordinators across the organization 
who act as the first point of contact for reporting 
and escalating any data privacy incidents or 
breaches. If an incident or a breach is determined 
to be of high impact, and / or if the law of the land 
mandates, such incidents or breaches are notified to 
the impacted data subjects and / or the supervisory 
authority. The notification includes the nature and 
extent of the incident or breach, the measures taken 
to mitigate the risks and prevent recurrence, and the 
contact details of the data privacy officer or the data 
protection officer. We also provide the data subjects 
with the necessary guidance and support to protect 
their rights and interests. We continuously monitor 
and evaluate the effectiveness of our data privacy 
incident management process and implement 
corrective and preventive actions to improve our 
data privacy posture. We also incorporate key 
learnings from incidents in privacy awareness 
stories and tips sent to employees. Incidents of 
high and critical nature are reported to the incident 
disclosure committee, consisting of senior leaders 
including the CEO. Infosys has zero tolerance for 
any breaches, which, in addition to appropriate 
preventive measures, are controlled through 
effective deterrent mechanisms including stringent 
consequence management.
In fiscal 2024, there was one substantiated 
complaint received concerning breach of customer 
privacy by external parties.
Data subject rights management 
Data subject rights, which have become an intrinsic 
part of data privacy laws in many countries, 
are legal rights enjoyed by the data subject. 
These rights are legally enforceable, but never 
absolute, with numerous interrelated and, at 
times, overlapping exceptions to be considered. 
This makes the fulfilment of data subject rights a 
complex exercise in the current enterprise setting, 
where data subjects as well as data in structured 
and unstructured formats are spread across 
systems and servers in multiple geographies with 
diverse regulatory regimes. Infosys has established 
necessary procedures and processes to optimally 
respond to such data subject rights requests within 
the legally stipulated timelines across Infosys 
locations, including subsidiaries.
Raising DP awareness through 
campaigns and events 
Every year, we celebrate the Data Privacy Day 
by hosting engaging interventions and diverse 
online interactive events like crosswords, quizzes, 
Pictionary, chat with DPO and messages from 
senior leaders to spread awareness. The events 
span over several months and rewards are offered 
to promote employee participation. Additionally, 
monthly awareness mailers in the form of privacy 
tips and scenarios reflecting changing threats 
are also sent organization wide to strengthen 
awareness. We conducted International Privacy 
Symposium 2022, a virtual conference organized 
by the Infosys Data Privacy Office in association 
with IAPP and ACC, where participants included 
global privacy leaders, CPOs, experts from academia 
and global frontline practitioners to reflect on key 
trends, challenges, and best practices. Some of the 
sessions organized as part of this included privacy 
engineering, anonymization, privacy-preserving 
synthetic data, AI, data ethics and human behavior, 
privacy standards, data subject rights and other 
emerging areas. A similar symposium is proposed 
to be organized in 2024 in collaboration with 
international bodies.
All employees and sub-contractors must also 
mandatorily complete privacy awareness quiz 
annually, the questions and scenarios are tailored 
based on their respective roles.
Driving DP thought leadership  
In this constantly changing privacy threat 
landscape, Infosys DPO recognizes the need for 
regular engagement with industry and government 
bodies to shape the future of data privacy. Towards 
this, it actively participates in various initiatives 
with industry forums and standard bodies globally, 
contributing to developing DP frameworks, 
policies, and standards. Infosys CPO is the co-
editor for ISO and IEEE standards related to privacy 
engineering, management, and privacy in emerging 
technologies, some of which have been published 
while others are being developed. Such emerging 
technologies include AI, digital twins, Metaverse 
and ZKP (Zero Knowledge Proof). 
Senior leaders from the DPO regularly speak in 
conferences of international repute, and actively 
engage with government bodies to help shape 
policy / regulations.

Cybersecurity management 
and reporting
The cybersecurity practices at Infosys have evolved 
to look beyond compliance. The comprehensive 
cybersecurity metrics program has been 
contributing to the continuous improvement of 
the existing security practices and integration of 
cybersecurity with the business processes. 
Information management, being an essential part of 
good IT governance, is a cornerstone at Infosys and 
has helped provide the organization with a robust 
foundation. There is a concerted effort from the top 
management to our end users in the development 
and implementation process. Additionally, care 
is taken to ensure that standardized policies 
or guidelines apply to and are practical for the 
organization’s culture, business, and operational 
practices. Cybersecurity requires participation 
from all spheres of the organization. Senior 
management, information security practitioners, 
IT professionals, and users have a pivotal role to 
play in securing the assets of an organization. The 
success of cybersecurity can only be achieved by 
full cooperation at all levels of an organization, both 
inside and outside and this is what defines the level 
of commitment here at Infosys.
As a final level of defense, we undergo many 
internal audits as well as external attestations and 
audits (e.g.: SSAE-18, ISO 27001) as well as client 
account audits to assess our security posture and 
compliance against our obligations on an ongoing 
basis.
There was one substantiated cybersecurity incident 
reported in fiscal 2024.
Our industry contributions and 
thought leadership
Infosys promotes cybersecurity through various 
social media channels such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and 
YouTube, sharing our point of views, whitepapers, 
service offerings, articles written by leaders, their 
interviews, and podcasts through our corporate 
handles providing thought leadership. In addition 
to this, we work with analysts such as PAC Group 
and industry bodies such as Data Security Council of 
India, Information Security Forum etc. to create joint 
thought leadership that is relevant to the industry 
practitioners. Our niche report “Invisible tech, Real 
impact.”, based on a study done in partnership with 
Interbrand (a top brand consultancy firm) estimates 
the impact on brand value due to data breaches. 
We also host various global chapters of the Infosys 
CISO advisory council regularly that aims to be a 
catalyst for innovation and transformation in the 
cybersecurity domain. The distinguished members 
of the council collaborate to discuss, strategize, and 
prepare roadmaps to address the current security 
challenges of member organizations and help 
decipher the evolving industry trends. 
Vulnerability management
The vulnerability management program at Infosys 
follows best-in-class industry practices coupled with 
top-notch processes that have been evolving over 
the years. The rich experience of deftly managing 
end-to-end vulnerability life cycle of the Infosys 
network and the constant hunger to stay abreast 
of the latest tools, technologies and related market 
intelligence have acted as a catalyst in fortifying the 
overall vulnerability management program.
A robust enterprise vulnerability management 
program builds the foundation for healthy security 
hygiene of an organization. The following practices 
have been put in place at Infosys for: 
1.	
Real-time asset discovery followed by 
instantaneous identification of vulnerabilities, 
misconfigurations, and timely remediation.
2.	
Automation of vulnerability management, 
configuration compliance, security assessments 
and review for assets, applications, network 
devices, data, and other entities in real time. 
3.	
Close coupling of detection and remediation 
processes; auto prioritization to reduce the 
turnaround time for closure of detected 
vulnerabilities.
4.	
Continuous monitoring of all public-facing 
Infosys sites and assets for immediate detection 
of vulnerabilities, ports, or services.
5.	
Regular penetration testing assessments and 
production application testing for detection 
and remediation of vulnerabilities on a real time 
basis. 
The vulnerability remediation strategy of Infosys 
focuses on threat-based prioritization, vulnerability 
ageing analysis and continuous tracking for 
timely closure. We have successfully eliminated 
the ticketing system for vulnerability tracking 
by establishing a continuous detection and 
remediation cycle, where the IT teams are enabled 
and onboarded onto the vulnerability management 
platform. A cybersecurity awareness culture is 
nurtured, and teams are encouraged to proactively 
remediate the vulnerabilities reported on their 
assets or applications. 
Supply risk management
A comprehensive supplier security risk management 
program at Infosys ensures effective management 
of potential security risks across the various stages 
of supplier engagement. The process comprises:
•	
Categorization of the suppliers based on 
the nature of the services provided and the 
sensitivity of the data involved.
•	
Defining standardized set of information security 
controls as applicable to each category of 
supplier.
•	
Defining, maintaining, and amending relevant 
security clauses in the supplier contracts as 
applicable to each category of supplier.
•	
Due diligence, security risk assessment for 
effective management of the information 
security risks associated with suppliers.
Defining and monitoring of key security metrics 
for suppliers (e.g., background check, security 
awareness training completion, timely interventions 
regarding information security incidents etc.) threat 
intel tracking, and governance further strengthen 
the Infosys supplier security risk management 
program.
Cybersecurity skill 
management
With the increasing demand for cybersecurity jobs 
and a skilled workforce, Infosys has taken several 
measures to counter the cybersecurity talent crisis 
and skill, retain and diversify its security workforce 
in areas such as application security and secure 
development lifecycle.

cybersecurity culture is one of the key constituents 
of our robust cybersecurity strategy. While we 
embrace top-notch tools and technology to bulk 
up our cybersecurity stance, the ‘human factor’ 
is equally an area of sharp focus for us. Various
