Chairman's Letter
Dear Stakeholders
We are pleased to present our 17th annual 
sustainability report. It outlines our sustainability 
journey and addresses emerging challenges and 
opportunities in the world. 
The year 2023-24 is notable for GenAI’s significant 
rise, potentially as impactful as electricity, 
semiconductors, and the internet. However, this 
year also saw climate change worsen. There have 
been multiple breaches of the safe threshold of 
1.5 degree centigrade rise in the global average 
temperature. 
This duality underscores the complex nature 
of progress. While new technologies like GenAI 
offers great promise, climate change remains the 
defining issue of our generation. When combined 
with ongoing geopolitical tensions and a modest 
global economic recovery, it places us at a crucial 
moment in history. One that calls for visionary 
leadership and urgent, immediate action to guide 
us toward a more promising future. 
No single entity can solve this problem alone. 
It needs creativity, innovation, partnerships, 
transparency and collaboration among markets, 
governments, and civil society to drive societal 
progress and create a better world for future 
generations. 
In this sustainability report, we outline how we at 
Wipro are addressing some of these challenges. 
As a responsible corporation, with strong values 
and governance, we see our role as stewards for 
all our stakeholders. These include employees, 
customers, investors, suppliers, communities and 
governments. We care about our communities. 
We are committed to fighting climate change and 
recognize there is still much to do.
Last year, we introduced a new sustainability 
dashboard. It has seven key goals. These include 
Climate Change, Water Stewardship, Diversity, 
Equity & Inclusion, Continuous Learning, Health & 
No single entity can solve this 
problem alone. It needs creativity, 
innovation, partnerships, 
transparency and collaboration 
among markets, governments, 
and civil society to drive societal 
progress and create a better world 
for future generations.

Well-being, Community Impact, and Responsible 
Technology Governance. This dashboard helps us 
track progress and adjust our goals as we move 
forward. 
The report details our progress in all the seven 
areas. I encourage you to review them thoroughly. 
Each area is equally important and urgent. 
However, for this letter, I want to highlight a few 
key points. 
Climate Change
We have placed sustainability at the core of 
our work and operations. We are always asking 
ourselves about how we can advance it with each 
new opportunity. For example, while GenAI offers 
immense possibilities, its rapid rise also presents 
significant energy challenges. These technologies 
are highly energy intensive, creating new hurdles 
for technology companies and energy utilities. 
We continuously collaborate with our partners 
and clients to address these issues. We are proud 
to report that we are making good progress on our 
climate action goals. 
Thanks to early investments in renewable 
energy and sustainable building design, we 
have exceeded our targets. Around 75% of our 
electricity in India now comes from renewable 
sources. This progress gives us confidence that 
we will achieve our 100% renewable energy goal 
before the target year of 2030. 
We are also ahead of our targets in reducing 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions. This is due to the 
widespread availability of solar power at or below 
grid cost. It is the result of a 35-fold increase in 
global production capacity and a four-fold drop in 
prices over less than a decade. 
Companies like ours are taking significant strides 
due to systemic improvements in solar power. 
However, meeting our Net Zero GHG emissions 
before 2040 will depend on replicating this 
success in other carbon-intensive sectors. These 
include electric mobility, low-carbon aviation, 
cement and steel. 
Continuous Learning and Responsible Tech
There is growing evidence that employees are 
more motivated and productive in workplaces that 
respect diverse perspectives, prioritize health 
and well-being, and offer continuous learning and 
advancement opportunities. 
Last year, nearly 225,000 Wipro employees, 
including myself, completed the basic GenAI 
course, with 30,000 advancing to more specialized 
modules. Reskilling our talent is crucial for 
sustaining our business and helping our clients 
transition to an AI-first world. However, we have 
adopted a broader perspective. 
We want everyone at Wipro to be AI literate. This 
is why our training extends beyond just billable 
roles. This underscores our commitment to 
creating a future-ready workforce. We have a 
strong belief that widespread GenAI literacy is 
essential for building an equal-opportunity world. 
AI is becoming more important to society. We need 
ethical boundaries and principles to ensure that 
it is used responsibly. We are developing a strong 
AI code of ethics. We are focusing on Responsible 
AI as well, integrating it throughout the entire 
design-to-execution cycle. We believe a human-
centred approach will bridge gaps, build trust, and 
maximize AI’s potential. 
We want everyone at Wipro to be 
AI literate. This is why our training 
extends beyond just billable roles. 
This underscores our commitment to 
creating a future-ready workforce. We 
have a strong belief that widespread 
GenAI literacy is essential for building 
an equal-opportunity world.
Health and Well-being 
We have refreshed our employee well-being 
program. It now emphasizes physical health, 
mental health, and community volunteering. We 
recognize that community volunteering enhances 
personal fulfilment and balance, thus improving

overall well-being. To build on this, we plan to 
significantly increase our employees’ volunteering 
efforts through partnerships in education, 
healthcare and ecology. The goal is to prepare 
them as both productive professionals and 
engaged citizens. 
Building on our longstanding commitment to 
education, healthcare and ecology, our efforts 
have reached nearly 4.5 million people. These 
include over 3 million children and 420,000 
women of reproductive age. Moving forward, 
we will focus more on climate adaptation and 
strengthening resilience among vulnerable 
communities in response to the widespread 
impact of climate change. 
Governance
We began our sustainability journey in 2008 
with GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) as our 
core framework. We still consider it as the gold 
standard for disclosures. We also participate 
in other reporting frameworks required by 
regulations or requested by customers and 
investors. 
This proliferation of frameworks can potentially 
help draw more companies into the sustainability 
space. However, we are aware of the risk of 
‘compliance fatigue.’ This may lead to a checkbox-
ticking mentality. Business must work closely with 
regulators to prevent this from happening, while 
also maintaining rigorous standards.
 
I want to emphasize that we highly value 
transparency and rigor in our disclosures. For 
instance, we are among the few companies 
worldwide that publish a monetary valuation 
of our environmental footprint. This year marks 
eight years since we began reporting our 
Environmental Profit & Loss statement. For FY24, 
our environmental impact quantified in monetary 
terms (including GHG emissions, air pollution, 
water consumption, solid waste and land use) 
amounted to $25,000 per million in revenue, or 
2.5% of our annual revenues. 
Moving forward, we will expand the scope. 
We plan to include the positive valuation of 
sustainability solutions for customers and 
human and social capital, providing a more 
comprehensive view of the shared value we 
create.
In conclusion, sustainability is fundamentally 
about “we” and “us” - the power of collective 
and collaborative efforts. Embracing this 
transformative spirit, we acknowledge and value 
the contributions of all our stakeholders. We look 
forward to a more fruitful journey ahead with your 
continued support and involvement. 
Thank You

Embedding Policy Commitments
Process to Remediate Negative Impacts
Sustainability being a multi-stakeholder game 
requires aligning with the right networks 
which acts as a force multiplier for our 
business. Wipro actively engaged with many 
top industry chambers/associations having 
an international reach of trade. We are in the 
leadership position at CII-Greenco. We actively 
participate in stakeholder consultations with 
NASSCOM, BfN (Business for Nature), WEF 
(World Economic Forum), Alliance for Clean Air, 
and REI (Responsible Energy Initiative). We also 
actively engage with CRB (Centre for Responsible 
Business), CII, the US Chamber of Commerce, 
BITKOM, IFCCI, and TechUK. 
Our contributions to industry associations this 
year are as follows:
Our Materiality Section outlines the key ESG 
and sustainability topics that are most material 
to us, as identified through our stakeholder 
engagements with our key stakeholders - 
employees, customers, suppliers, investors, 
and local communities. We engage with our 
stakeholders through various forums regularly. 
Through these engagements, we have identified 
key material topics, such as environmental 
impact, corporate social responsibility, health and 
safety, human rights, and business conduct. 
Each of our ESG goals is linked to the policies that 
govern them. These commitments are integrated 
into the strategy of each Function, and procedures 
and processes are outlined for working toward 
these commitments. These policies are developed 
based on globally accepted frameworks and 
norms, industry benchmarking, and consultations 
with senior leadership, experts, and our identified 
stakeholders. Some policies we have developed 
We encourage our employees to report any 
fraudulent financial or other information, 
instances of a leak or suspected leak of 
unpublished price-sensitive information, and 
any conduct that violates the company’s code of 
business conduct. We ensure that these reports 
can be made anonymously if desired. We strictly 
prohibit discrimination, retaliation, or harassment 
against any employee who reports under the Vigil 
Mechanism or participates in the investigation.

Statement on Sustainable 
Development Goals
At Wipro, our commitment to sustainability and 
social responsibility is at the heart of everything 
we do. We align our operations with the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
(UNSDGs), a global blueprint for a better and 
more sustainable future. These goals focus on 
achieving sustainable development across three 
dimensions – economic, social and environmental 
– in a balanced and integrated manner. 
Out of 17 interconnected goals, addressing the 
world’s most pressing challenges, the following 
are relevant to Wipro and its businesses and have 
a direct positive impact through our initiatives.
GRI 2-22
We create awareness of our policies by sending 
group mailers that highlight the actions taken 
against errant employees. The mechanism 
followed under the Ombuds process is displayed 
on the company’s intranet and website.
All complaints received through the Ombuds 
process are reviewed and approved by the Chief 
Ombuds person or designate. Employees and 
stakeholders can register their concerns by 
sending an email or through our web-based 
portal.
Following an investigation of the concerns 
received, a decision is made by the appropriate 
authority based on the findings of the 
investigation. If the complainant is non-
responsive for more than 15 days, the concern 
may be closed without further action.
During the financial year 2023-24, we received 
1222 complaints , disposed off 1230 complaints 
(including open cases from last year), and 
had 76 complaints pending at the end of the 
financial year. All cases were investigated, and 
actions were taken as deemed appropriate. 
18% of these cases were reported anonymously. 
The top categories of complaints were non-
adherence to internal policy/process (40%), 
hiring-related concerns (14%), and behavioral 
issues (13%). Most cases were resolved 
through the engagement of other internal 
functions, mediation, or closed as they were 
unsubstantiated. 
The Audit, Risk, and Compliance Committee 
periodically reviews the functioning of this 
mechanism. We ensure that no personnel of the 
company are denied access to the Audit, Risk, 
and Compliance Committee.

Overview
Governance Structure and Composition 
An effective ESG strategy is one that is aligned 
with and incorporated into the company’s long-
term business strategy. This section outlines 
Wipro’s corporate governance practices related  
to environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
issues. At Wipro, the Spirit of Wipro values and 
the Five Habits form the basis of our corporate 
governance and operations. We are committed 
to protecting the interests of all stakeholders 
by institutionalizing a strong system of checks 
and balances, promote transparency, ensuring 
compliance, and embedding a culture of 
integrity and accountability at each level of the 
organization.
At the heart of this commitment is the Board 
of Directors. Their role is not just to oversee 
and guide but to inspire and drive meaningful 
change. They foster a culture of ethical conduct 
and transparency, ensuring that Wipro remains 
resilient, agile, and capable of navigating 
challenges in a rapidly evolving business
landscape. Our approach to corporate governance 
covers the key aspects of governance, its 
structure, composition, roles and responsibilities.
 
Our Corporate Governance philosophy is put 
into practice at Wipro through the following four 
functional layers, namely: 
The Board of Directors has designated one 
Independent Director as Lead Independent 
Director. They are responsible for coordinating 
the activities of other Independent Directors 
and performing various other duties. Two of 
the six Independent Directors are women. The 
Board is well diversified in terms of age, skills,

about responsible business conduct in Wipro’s 
operations and business relationships through 
Ombuds Policy. Under this policy, our Company 
encourages its employees to report any incidence 
of fraudulent financial or other information to the 
stakeholders, reporting of instance(s) of a leak 
or suspected leak of unpublished price-sensitive 
information, and any conduct that results in 
violation of the Company’s code of business 
conduct, to the management (on an anonymous 
basis, if employees so desire). Further, our 
Company has prohibited discrimination, 
retaliation, or harassment of any kind against any 
employee who reports under the Vigil Mechanism 
or participates in the investigation. The detailed 
policy can be found here.

Sustainability Governance
Wipro’s sustainability program is boundaryless. 
It includes corporate sustainability  - the 
organization running its business with integrity 
while ensuring that the ecological footprint of 
its operations is minimized; and community 
initiatives - looking beyond the boundaries of 
the organization and contributing toward the 
development of the larger community. 
Wipro’s journey of creating sustainable 
governance starts with aligning its governance 
with sustainability goals. Wipro’s sustainability 
program is governed by the Nomination and

Reporting Structure
Risk Management Framework
Risk Management Process
Risk Management 
Wipro follows a meticulous reporting structure. 
We operate our multiple sustainability initiatives 
based on the principle of building a coalition of 
partners, both internal and external. The Global 
Head of Sustainability oversees the operation 
of sustainability programs and reporting. This 
includes the responsibility of formally reviewing 
and approving sustainability disclosures and 
Our Next-Gen Risk Management framework is 
based on globally recognized standards and 
industry best practices. It is designed to be 
agile to proactively navigate uncertainties and 
capitalize on the opportunities in this dynamic 
business environment. The framework enables 
and supports business objectives through risk-
intelligent assessments while focusing on the 
continuous identification and mitigation of all 
categories of risks, including emerging risks. We 
further strengthen our framework through the 
adoption of Generative AI. The framework has 
been digitized to enable businesses to make 
faster, informed, and quality risk-based decisions, 
encouraging a risk-resilient culture. It is 
administered by the Audit, Risk, and Compliance 
Committee of the Board and is supported by a 
multi-layered risk governance structure across 
the organization.
Risk Identification and Exposure
Risk identification in each category is done 
through an analysis of regulatory and business 
requirements as well as customer feedback. A 
detailed risk exposure is conducted at the Function 
level to identify the potential impact magnitude and 
likelihood of risk occurrence. In addition, stakeholder 
engagement, brainstorming sessions, and scenario 
planning exercises are conducted to refine risk 
identification further. Every function maintains a 
Risk Register with the identified risks within their 
respective functions.  Identified risks are tracked 
through the Risk and Governance module in our 
internal module. 
The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) every quarter reviews 
all the top risks with the Audit, Risk, and 
Compliance Committee to the Board. In addition, 
the internal audit findings are also shared with the 
CRO. All our top risks are reported in the Annual 
Report. Please refer to page 92 of the Wipro's 
Integrated Annual Report FY2023-24.
Our Operational Risk Framework (ORF), enables 
comprehensive risk identification through a 
collaborative approach between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd 
lines of defense, across all risk categories. The 
first line of defense is the Function. The second 
line of defense can be the Information security

team, risk management team, data privacy team, or 
business resilience team, based on the type of risk. 
The third line of defense is the Internal Audit team 
which directly reports to the Board. Wipro has a 
rigorous process to identify, manage, and mitigate 
risks, as explained below. We do this through 
our internal portal where the Risk & Governance 
module is housed. This module manages the 
risk process across the risk lifecycle–Risk 
identification, risk assessment -impact, likelihood, 
velocity, net & residual severity, monitoring 
controls & their effectiveness, treatment, and 
reporting.

Every risk is assessed periodically for progress. 
The frequency of assessment depends upon the 
severity of the risk and could range from monthly 
to quarterly.
Risk Appetite and Tolerance
Risk appetite defines the level of risk that a 
company is willing to accept. The Risk Governance 
committee goes through a rigorous process and 
works closely with the Business, Functions, 
and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team 
to set the risk appetite and tolerance. The Risk 
Appetite Framework empowers Wipro Business 
units (Strategic Market Units and Global Business 
Lines) and Functions to make independent 
decisions based on their risk tolerance and the 
performance of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs). KRIs 
and tolerance limits are revisited yearly based 
on Strategic Priorities and Key Performance 
Indicators set for the financial year and inputs 
from external consulting firms. Wipro has a well-
established quarterly process to assess risk 
performance for Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) by 
Functions and Business units.  Business units 
(Strategic Market Units and Global Business 
Lines) and Functions define a ‘Mitigation Action 
Plan’ for any KRIs that are underperforming. Risk 
Appetite Dashboard is published to Business 
units (Strategic Market Units and Global Business 
Lines) and Functions heads, CXOs, and CROs with 
details of KRIs, their performance, and trends. 
Risk Treatment
Every function has to ensure that its risks are 
within the appetite and tolerance limits set by the 
organization. They work closely with the second 
lines of defense to strengthen processes and 
controls.
Risk Monitoring and Reporting
All open risks are monitored on an ongoing 
basis by the functions and reported to the risk 
governance committee. Top risks across the 
organization are reviewed quarterly with the 
Audit, Risk, and Compliance Committee on the 
Board. Ongoing top risks and their mitigation 
plans are reviewed with the Risk and Governance 
Committee consisting of leaders from Business 
and Functions. Also, there are Risk Councils at 
Business, Functions, Geography, Location, and 
Risk Theme levels (Responsible usage of GenAI, 
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC), etc.).
Risk Audit
Stress testing at defined frequencies is done 
by the various second lines of defense – risk 
management, cybersecurity and information 
security, data privacy, or business resilience, 
and the third line of defense – internal audit 
committees. The internal audit process is aligned 
with the ISO 31000 guidelines. Following that, 
the internal audit’s findings are reported to the 
Board’s Audit, Risk, and Compliance Committee 
every quarter. 
Our Risk Management process is benchmarked 
by third-party organizations, such as the Big 4 
consulting companies. In FY24, we received an 
encouraging benchmarking score (92%) and an 
acknowledgment that Wipro has achieved an 
advanced level of maturity concerning its ERM 
practices.
Risk Management Policies
Wipro has several risk management policies and 
frameworks, e.g., those relating to Cybersecurity 
and Information Security, Data Privacy, Risk 
Assurance which defines risk ownership, Risk 
Appetite and Tolerance, Risk Acceptance and 
Retiral Policy, Country Risk Framework, Anti-
Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC) program, 
Emerging Risk and Risk Framework for Acquired 
Entity. These are some of the policies that help us 
timely identify and manage risks effectively.

Risk Culture
At the core of the Enterprise Risk Culture 
Awareness Program lies a well-architected 
In an era where cyber threats are evolving and 
escalating in their sophistication, a robust 
and comprehensive cybersecurity strategy is 
paramount. Wipro's Enterprise Risk Culture 
and Awareness Program exemplifies a holistic 
approach to cybersecurity, weaving together 
various critical components into a cohesive 
overall strategy. 
Employees are introduced to the fundamentals 
of cybersecurity from the moment they join the 
organization. This education which is based on the 
NIST 2 standards continues through their career 
at Wipro, with advanced modules and training 
sessions designed to address the evolving threat 
landscape. This lifecycle approach ensures that 
every employee, regardless of their tenure or role, 
possesses a solid foundation in cybersecurity 
principles and practices. 
A distinguishing feature of the Enterprise Risk 
Culture Awareness Program is the blend of 
e-modules and instructor-led training. This hybrid 
model caters to diverse learning preferences, 
allowing employees to engage with the material in 
a manner that best suits their learning style.
strategic framework. This framework is designed 
to pre-emptively identify potential phishing 
threats and to equip employees with the 
knowledge and tools necessary to mitigate these 
risks. The strategy encompasses a range of 
intervention models, including simulated phishing 
exercises, real-time threat analysis, and adaptive 
learning modules. These interventions are not 
static. They evolve in response to the changing 
tactics of cyber adversaries, ensuring that the 
organization's defenses remain robust and 
proactive.

This initiative provides employees a hands-on 
experience in identifying and responding to 
phishing attempts. By simulating real-world 
phishing scenarios (that are periodically reviewed 
and updated), the program helps sharpen 
employees' vigilance and improves their ability to 
recognize and report potential threats. 
Expansion of Role-Based Awareness Training
Recognizing that different roles within the 
organization face unique cybersecurity 
challenges, the program includes an expansion 
of role-based awareness training. These trainings 
are tailored to the specific needs and risk profiles 
of various roles from senior leadership to new 
hires, Finance, HR, GPO, etc., providing targeted 
awareness and resources. These role-based 
trainings ensure all employees are equipped to 
protect themselves and the organization from 
cyber threats.
Through this holistic approach, Wipro is preparing 
its employees to defend against phishing 
and other cyber threats while fostering an 
organizational culture where cybersecurity is 
everyone's responsibility.

Wipro and its Stakeholders
GRI 3
Process to Determine Material Topics
In the tapestry of sustainability, stakeholders 
are the threads that bind us together. Engaging 
stakeholders is at the core of our commitment to 
understanding and addressing material issues. 
It is about fostering connections with those 
who matter most. In our quest for inclusivity, 
we have identified six vital stakeholder groups. 
They are the pillars of our ecosystem, each with 
a unique role and voice. A detailed description of 
our stakeholder engagement process, including 
topics of engagement, frequency of engagement 
and impact can be found on pages 40-41 of 
Wipro's Integrated Annual Report FY2023-24.
Stakeholder engagement is a relationship to be 
nurtured, it is key to staying connected with the 
material issues. It is about recognizing that our 
success is intertwined with the well-being of all 
stakeholders, from employees to customers to 
communities. It serves to understand the risks 
IDENTIFY- Identifying ESG topics using 
input from internal stakeholders, peer

DESIGN- Develop a methodology for 
stakeholder engagement that includes 
the identification of a representative set 
of internal and external stakeholders and 
customized questionnaires to capture the 
stakeholders’ responses.

Over time, our approach to stakeholder 
engagement has evolved, adapting to the 
changing needs of our dynamic world. But one 
thing remains constant: our senior management’s 
unwavering commitment to meaningful 
engagement and utilizing stakeholder insights to 
drive positive change. 
It’s also important to understand and identify 
attributes of stakeholders that makes them 
important to business hence our approach to 
identify stakeholders is multifaceted, driven 
by the Impact, Influence, Interest, Legitimacy, 
Urgency, and Diverse Perspectives. These 
qualities serve as our compass, guiding us 
to those stakeholders whose interactions 
significantly shape our journey.

List of Material Topics
GRI 3-2
In conducting our materiality assessment, an 
initial list of 50 material topics was considered. 
Stakeholder-specific questionnaires were 
developed and responses were sought from all 
stakeholders – employees, customers, investors 
and suppliers. A total of approximately 530 
stakeholder responses were recorded and two 
in-depth focus group discussions were held 
with Wipro’s leaders. In addition to internal and 
external stakeholder responses, external market 
context such as customer expectations, multiple 
ESG frameworks, and standards were considered 
to further distill material topics. Based upon this 
exercise, the topics were filtered down to 25, and 
Materiality Matrix
organized into 8 main themes. The responses 
were mapped. Topics closer to the 45-degree 
line indicate an alignment between internal and 
external stakeholder views in terms of relevance, 
importance and potential impact. These were 
collated and the materiality matrix outlines the 
broad themes that are considered material to 
Wipro. The ones in purple represent issues that 
are core to Wipro, while the others represent 
emerging issues. Environment stewardship and 
climate action were rated high by at least 2 
stakeholders and lie at the very core of Wipro’s 
value system.

Taxation 
Risks
Profits earned from services 
outside India may be subject to 
taxation in the country where 
the work is performed. 
Most of our taxes paid abroad can 
be used as credit against Indian tax 
liability. We also benefit from certain tax 
incentives, such as a tax holiday 
for businesses operating from 
designated SEZs.
Wage 
Pressure
While wages have been 
historically lower in India 
compared to the USA or 
Europe, wage increase in India 
could impact our competitive 
advantage.
Increase employee compensation to 
retain talent. Enhance efficiency and 
productivity to offset wage increases. 
Explore talent sourcing from other low-
cost locations. 
Credit 
Risk
Possibility of customers not 
settling obligations. 
Regularly assess credit ratings, 
monitor financial reliability, and 
diversify customer base. No significant 
concentration of credit risk. 
Foreign Currency 
Risk
Exposure to exchange 
rate fluctuations due to 
international transactions.
Manage foreign exchange risk by 
monitoring revenue, receivables, and 
payables. Appreciation of the Indian 
Rupee against major currencies can 
impact results.
Interest 
Rate Risk
This risk primarily arises from 
floating rate investments and 
borrowings.
Use interest rate swap agreements to 
manage exposure. Focus on short-term 
investments to minimize interest rate 
risk.
Financial Assistances from Governments
We have not received any other direct or indirect 
financial assistance beyond the scope of the 
state policy. The Company has complied with 
the requirements of Stock Exchanges or SEBI on

Climate Strategy
We are committed to fostering a sustainable 
future aligned with Spirit of Wipro’s principles 
of responsibility and integrity. Aiming for Net 
Zero emissions by 2040, we have set specific 
targets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
by 59% from our 2017 baseline and Scope 3 
emissions by 55% from our 2020 baseline by 
2030. Recognized by the Science Based Targets 
initiative, our strategy emphasizes emission 
mitigation and business resilience. We conduct 
rigorous materiality exercises and climate risk 
assessments to guide our initiatives. 
By investing in energy conservation and 
transitioning to renewable energy, Wipro 
currently powers 76% of its facilities with 
renewables, cutting CO2e emissions by over 
101,002 tonnes. Our water management targets 
include a 60% efficiency improvement by 2030 
and extensive rainwater harvesting. Waste 
management involves rigorous segregation, 
recycling, and disposal processes, achieving a 
94% recycling rate. These efforts are supported 
by detailed monitoring and adherence to global 
best practices.

Energy Management 
At Wipro, we are dedicated to creating a 
sustainable and resilient future, guided by 
The Spirit of Wipro, which embodies our 
commitment to responsibility and unwavering 
integrity. Recognizing that our journey toward 
sustainability begins with reducing our own 
carbon footprint, we have implemented 
significant measures over the past decades 
to minimize our emissions. In 2018, we set 
ambitious targets to achieve Net Zero emissions 
across our operations and value chain by 2040. 
By 2030, our goals include reducing our combined 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions 
by 59% from our 2017 baseline and cutting 
Scope 3 absolute emissions by 55% from our 
2020 baseline. To reach these milestones, we are 
investing in both energy conservation as well as 
energy transition activities. Our commitment to 
these goals has been formally recognized by the 
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which 
validated our targets in 2021.  
The data for all the environmental parameters 
presented in this section are from sites that are 
under Wipro's operational control.
A crucial lever for reducing emissions from our 
operations is the transition to clean energy. 
Energy consumption significantly contributes 
to our carbon footprint, driven by the electricity 
needs of our operations and data centers. 
Notably, around 90% of our electricity usage is 
Our Energy program is governed by our Energy 
Policy. It is managed by the Facilities Management 
Group, aided by the Procurement Group. While 
the former focuses on energy efficiency and 
conversation, the transition to renewable energy 
is handled by both Facilities and Procurement. 
Out Infrastructure Group designs and implements 
energy-efficient buildings. Wipro has 36 LEED-
certified buildings. This group is also constantly 
implementing energy-efficient solutions within 
concentrated in India, where our large operational 
centers are located. We have considered 26 sites 
under Wipro’s operational control for the current 
year’s environmental assessment. The primary 
sources of energy demand for our operations 
include air conditioning, lighting, and allied 
electrical systems. 
Our top priorities are energy efficiency and 
conservation and transitioning to renewable 
energy. Energy efficiency involves deploying 
energy-efficient devices, while energy 
conservation focuses on measures such as 
cooling only occupied areas of buildings. We are 
continually striving to reduce our energy intensity 
and enhance the efficiency of both our physical 
and digital infrastructure. Each year, we are 
increasing the share of renewable energy in our 
overall consumption. Our goal is to transition to 
100% renewable energy across all facilities under 
our ownership and operational control by 2030.

our existing infrastructure. We have adopted  
ISO 50001 EMS across our campuses. Three 
campuses (Kodathi, Chennai, and Sarjapur 2) 
received certifications in August 2022, accounting 
for 35% of the total operational office space 
Our overall energy consumption is monitored 
at a central location called the Global Energy 
Command Centre (GECC).  
Energy Consumption 
Energy Intensity 
Currently, 76% of the purchased electricity for 
our facilities under operational control comes 
from renewable sources, making it our primary 
energy source. This includes 520.3 million MJ of 
purchased renewable energy and 10.7 million 
MJ self-generated through solar PV, totaling 
approximately 732.1 million MJ of energy. This 
transition has resulted in emissions savings of 
over 101,002 tonnes of CO2e, equivalent to taking 
more than 24,039 cars off the road for a year 
or the carbon sequestered by over 1.7 million 
seedlings grown for ten years (source: EPA). The 
sources of our renewable energy vary by location 
and largely consist of green tariffs and Private 
Purchase Agreements (PPA). This year, we have 
also invested in Group Captive, which we expect 
will significantly increase our share of renewable 
energy. 
In FY24, we purchased around 163 million MJ of 
grid power and consumed another 37.8 million 
MJ of diesel-generated backup power. Total 
energy consumption from renewable sources 
is around 76%. There is no energy consumption 
for heating, or cooling purposes in FY23-24. The 
following dashboard presents the distribution 
of our overall energy consumption for our owned 
and operated locations. We have considered 
DEFRA 2023 version 1.1 and BPCL (Bharat 
Petroleum) conversion factors to calculate the 
energy consumption in MJ. Our leased facilities, 
where we do not have direct control, consume 
an additional 18.6 million MJ of electricity 
(calculation based on leased floor area using the 
IEA database). 
Energy intensity is calculated considering 
all sources of energy at an organization level 
with sites under direct operational control 
(specifically India). 
We continue working to lower the correlation 
between our business growth and non-renewable 
energy consumption.

Efficiency and Reduction 
When designing our new facilities, we prioritize 
optimizing overall performance, focusing on both 
efficiency and user experience. Our commitment 
to energy efficiency is exemplified in our recent 
facilities in Bengaluru and Hyderabad, which 
adhere to global best practices. Both campuses 
boast an Energy Performance Index (EPI) of 
below 80 units per square meter per annum at 
full occupancy. Additionally, these buildings 
eliminate the use of UPS batteries by replacing 
them with rotary UPS, thus reducing the 
environmental impact associated with battery 
manufacturing and disposal. 
We are also enhancing the performance of 
our existing campuses through various energy 
efficiency measures. These include retrofitting 
technologies to improve Chiller and Air Handling 
Units (AHUs), UPS optimization, integrating the 
design with energy-efficient principles, and 
utilizing monitoring platforms such as the Global 
Energy Command Centre (GECC).  
The GECC aggregates inputs from the Building 
Management System (BMS) onto a common 
platform to optimize operational control and 
improve energy efficiency. It integrates every 
energy-consuming system within Wipro facilities 
globally, connecting to individual IoT-enabled 
devices and sensors.
Currently, approximately 15.2 million square feet 
across India are connected to the BMS, covering 
68% of our total office space. 
Case Study: Energy Savings 
from the Chiller Unit
Our BMS system connected to our Global 
Energy Command Center (GECC) has resulted in 
energy optimization and cost savings across our 
facilities. To take a specific case study at one 
of our Bengaluru locations, the GECC platform 
resulted in streamlining our Chiller operations 
and increasing efficiency. Data analysis from 
the GECC platform revealed inefficiencies in the 
Chiller system, such as poor health monitoring 
and random operations. A new configuration of 
the system was implemented to achieve the same 
performance.
The new configuration resulted in a 40% 
reduction in energy consumption by the Chiller 
system, resulting in cost savings of ₹18 million 
per annum.

Emissions 
Our approach to energy efficiency and GHG mitigation is centered on the following approach. 
At Wipro, we strive to achieve a robust 
mechanism for measuring and reporting 
performance metrics to set scientifically valid, 
traceable, and accountable goals. We follow the 
methodologies outlined in the GHG Protocol 
to measure and track our Scope 1, Scope 2, 
and Scope 3 emissions. In FY24, our total GHG 
emissions amounted to approximately 2,11,116 
tCO2e. This figure encompasses our Scope 1, 
Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, calculated using 
relevant DEFRA factors. 
Our near-term emissions goals include: 
•	
Reducing combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions by 59% from our 2017 baseline* by 
2030. 
•	
Reducing scope 3 absolute emissions by 55% 
from our 2020 baseline* by 2030. 
*Baseline year emissions: The Baseline year was 
chosen as 2017 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions and 2020 
for Scope 3 as per SBTi guidelines. Baseline year 
emissions for Scope 1 and 2 is 195453 tonnes CO2e and 
Scope 3 was 281213 (top 3 categories) tonnes CO2e. We 
have included all the gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, 
SF6, NF3, or all) in the calculation of GHG Emissions as 
CO2e. 
Baselining energy and 
emissions parameters
Setting ambitious, scientifically 
valid and traceable goals
Developing robust 
mitigation programs
As of FY24, our emissions profile is detailed as 
follows: 
•	
Scope 1 emissions: Comprising slightly over 
3.1% of our total emissions, these primarily 
stem from fuel use in backup generators, 
natural gas consumption, and refrigerant 
leakage at our facilities. Biogenic emissions 
(4 kg CO2e) have been also considered for the 
financial year. 
•	
Scope 2 emissions: Accounting for nearly 
15.4% of our total emissions, these are 
predominantly due to the electricity 
consumption of facilities under our 
operational control. 
•	
Scope 3 emissions: Representing about 81.6% 
of our total GHG emissions, these indirect 
emissions arise from various sources within 
our value chain, including upstream fuel and 
energy, employee commutes, business travel, 
purchased goods and services, upstream 
and downstream leased assets, and waste 
emissions.

Emission Intensity 
Wipro was one of the first few companies in the 
world to have approved SBTi targets. Our 2040 Net 
Zero targets as well as progress on our near-term 
targets are closely monitored every quarter by the 
Wipro Executive Committee, of which our Chief 
Sustainability Officer1 and our Chief Executive 
Officer are a part.  
Wipro is a founding member of Transform to 
Net Zero and the Clean Air Alliance, which focuses 
on measuring and mitigating air emissions other 
than greenhouse gases.  
Our facilities rely on air conditioning and cooling 
systems that use ozone-depleting refrigerants. 
The refrigerants used by the organization in 
the financial year: R-134 A, R-22, R-32,	
R-404 
A, R-407 A, R-407 B, R-407 C, and R-410a. In FY24, 
our total refrigerant consumption, measured in 
CFC-11 equivalents, was 2.44 tonnes. Preventing 
refrigerant leaks and finding low global warming 
potential (GWP) alternatives are critical for 
reducing global emissions. To address this, we 
are enhancing our ability to accurately measure 
refrigerant leak rates and developing new 
technology solutions to prevent these leaks. 
In addition to refrigerants, our diesel generator 
units, which provide backup power, emitted 
26.93 tonnes of NOx, 6.04 tonnes of SOx, and 
1.48 tonnes of particulate matter in FY24. 
Stack concentration is location-specific and 
based on the capacity of diesel generators, flow 
rate, the number of hours used, and the gases 
emitted. These are monitored for ambient air 
quality checks every month to keep them within 
the permissible limits prescribed by the State 
Pollution Control Boards. 
Addressing GHG emissions is a critical component 
of our sustainability strategy. Our approach to 
reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions has 
primarily focused on decarbonization—reducing 
or eliminating greenhouse gases from our 
operations through transitioning to renewable 
energy and enhancing energy efficiency. For 
Scope 3 emissions, our efforts have centered 
on improving the accuracy of our baseline 
measurements and establishing robust processes 
to mitigate emissions. These mitigation efforts 
involve integrating policies and procedures into 
relevant business functions to ensure a sustained 
effort to reduce emissions. 
Given that more than 80% of our GHG 
emissions originate from Scope 3, mitigating 
these emissions is both challenging and 
essential for meeting our goals. We have been 
consistently working to calibrate and improve 
the measurement of our Scope 3 GHG emissions. 
As a result of our continuous efforts, we have 
achieved a significant year-on-year decline in 
emissions intensities across various metrics 
including revenue, employee count, and floor 
area. Emission intensity is considers all sources 
of emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) at an organization 
level with sites under direct operational control 
(specifically India).

Shared below are some of our efforts to mitigate 
our scope 3 emissions: 
Upstream Fuel and Energy
We are implementing several proactive 
measures, to control and mitigate our upstream 
fuel and energy emissions. We are investing 
heavily in transitioning to renewables and 
energy-efficient technologies and equipment 
across our operations to reduce overall energy 
consumption. Also, we are collaborating with 
suppliers to encourage sustainable practices 
and technologies, such as reducing reliance on 
fossil fuels and implementing emission-reduction 
strategies. Conducting regular energy audits and 
performance reviews of upstream facilities is 
helping us to identify areas for improvement and 
track progress toward emission reduction targets. 
Business Travel
Following the pandemic, business travel initially 
surged in the first half of FY24 but moderated in 
the second half due to internal cost efficiency 
targets. To reduce high-carbon travel, we are 
planning to implement the following strategies: 
•	
Utilizing alternative modes of travel, such as 
trains and buses, especially in regions like 
India and the EU. 
•	
Launching employee awareness programs and 
incentives. 
•	
Promoting voluntary low-carbon travel choices 
within our top delivery accounts through 
focused awareness campaigns.
Employee Commute
As employees return to work, GHG emissions from 
commuting have increased. Our multi-faceted 
approach includes promoting low-footprint 
transportation options such as buses, trains, and 
carpooling. We are proud to be the first major 
Indian business to join EV100, a global initiative 
by the Climate Group to promote electric mobility. 
We have committed to transitioning our entire 
global fleet to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030, 
with formal EV contracts already in place in 
Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Kochi. Notably, our 
Kochi campus has achieved 100% EV deployment. 
Currently, EV and CNG commuting account for 
nearly 43% of the total distance traveled by our 
owned fleet. However, emissions from employees' 
private transport remain significant. To address 
this, we are exploring employee incentives and 
partnerships with public transport providers.
Purchased Goods and Services
We collaborate with suppliers committed to 
sustainability throughout their value chains. Our 
engagement with suppliers, including those in 
hardware procurement and indirect services, 
focuses on reducing energy consumption and 
GHG emissions, alongside other environmental 
and social commitments. Our “Supplier Code 
of Conduct” mandates these efforts. We have 
received the prestigious EPEAT award for 
excellence in sustainable technology procurement 
seven times consecutively and earned a five-
star rating for the third time. We actively engage 
with our suppliers through the CDP supply chain 
platform, being the first India-based company 
to use this platform formally and actively. 
Additionally, we have launched the Wipro Initiative 
for Supplier Engagement (WISE) program to work 
with our suppliers on measuring emissions and 
setting reduction targets. Further details can be 
found in the “Supplier Synergies” section.
Case Study – Wipro’s Fair 
Travel Program
Wipro has just launched a Fair Travel Program 
along with a partner to address Business 
Travel Emissions. The program focuses on a 
collaborative approach to create and implement 
policies to curb business travel. Account-wise 
baseline emissions from business travel have 
been established over the past year. The goal 
of this program is to set account-wise targets 
for emissions reduction through a collaborative 
approach. This will include stakeholder 
participation, system upgradation, and policy 
implementation.

Water Management 
At Wipro, we approach water management 
through three interconnected lenses: 
1) Conservation
2) Responsibility
3) Security
Our goals are built on these dimensions, forming 
the foundation of our water stewardship 
strategy. This strategy focuses on assessing 
and addressing water-related risks to our 
business while also working with partners on 
scalable solutions for stakeholders outside of 
Wipro’s boundary. Recognizing urban water as 
a boundaryless issue, we also work beyond our 
operational boundaries to enhance shared water 
resources. 
Our water goals include: 
•	
Improving the efficiency of freshwater use by 
60% in all owned facilities by 2030, aiming for 
a year-on-year improvement of 10% in water 
efficiency per employee on a compounded 
basis. 
•	
Increasing the proportion of recycled water to 
60% by FY30, with an interim target of 50% by 
FY26. 
•	
Achieving zero discharge. 
Additionally, we are committed to contributing 
to a deeper understanding of the systemic 
challenges of urban water management in the 
major cities in India where we operate.  
Water efficiency
Improve water efficiency 
(fresh water use per 
employee) of our operations.
Responsible management
To ensure responsible 
sourcing and responsible 
water management in 
proximate communities, 
especially in locations that 
are prone to water scarcity.
Case Study – Rainwater Harvesting
In FY23-24, we harvested over 11.13 million 
litres of rainwater, which was either stored for 
use or directed to the ground through recharge 
wells. Additionally, we commissioned a 2,000 
KL rainwater harvesting project at our Chennai 
campus, reinforcing our commitment to 
environmental sustainability.
Water Management
Wipro’s water management is governed by our 
Water Policy. We are committed to the judicious 
use of our water resources. Our continuous 
improvement plan includes ensuring adequate 
metering across our campuses, ensuring 
smooth operation of our sewage treatment 
plants, and ensuring efficient reuse of treated 
water. Rainwater harvesting also forms part 
of our overall water strategy. All water-related 
action plans are implemented by the Facilities 
Management team, which works closely with the 
Sustainability team. The progress against our 
Water Targets is monitored quarterly by the Wipro 
Executive Committee. 
Water security
Recognizing water availability 
as a business risk, to 
proactively assess and plan 
for the water security of the 
organization in a manner that 
is congruent with the other 
two objectives.

In addition, we map our climate-related water 
risks across all our facilities. Based upon the risks 
identified, we create business resilience plans 
at all of our sites. These are closely monitored 
by the Business Continuity team as well as the 
Enterprise Risk Management team. More details 
are available in the Climate Strategy section. 
Water Withdrawal 
Water Discharge
Our freshwater use is sourced from third-
party purchases and groundwater. Third-party 
water mainly includes municipal and private 
supplies, with the latter primarily sourced 
from groundwater. Municipal water supplies 
are typically drawn from rivers or lakes. In-situ 
groundwater accounts for approximately 4% of 
our total freshwater consumption across various 
cities in India. Additionally, we are focused on 
harvesting rainwater to reduce our dependence 
on conventional freshwater sources and to 
promote sustainability. There is no direct impact 
on water sources due to water withdrawal by the 
organization. 
The table below details our total water withdrawal 
and also highlights withdrawals from water-
stressed regions: 
We have state-of-the-art sewage treatment 
facilities that enable the effective reuse of 
treated water. Some of these plants are equipped 
with nanofiltration to produce high-quality 
water for our chillers. All our water is treated, 
and all treated water is reused. However, there 
is a minimal amount of discharge from one of 
our facilities. We take care not to discharge 
wastewater into any subsurface waters, surface 
waters or sewers that lead directly to rivers, 
oceans, lakes, wetlands, and groundwater. 
The treated water from our sewage treatment 
plants is tested and are in conformance with 
the parameters specified by the respective local 
pollution control boards. 
In addition, we are exploring partnerships with 
organizations to secure treated water for our 
campuses to reduce our reliance on freshwater 
sources. We are also intensifying efforts to 
safeguard our water resources both within and 
outside our campuses.

Waste Management 
Collection and Disposal
Wipro’s commitment to sustainability drives us 
to transform waste into a valuable resource. This 
eco-friendly transformation involves various 
steps from the segregation of generated waste 
to its proper disposal. Wipro’s approach to waste 
management involves the following process: 
The processes that Wipro adopts for collecting 
and monitoring waste-related data reflect 
its commitment to managing waste-related 
impacts. Such processes can include online data 
entry utilizing digital platforms, maintaining 
a centralized database, continuous tracking, 
monitoring, and annual external data validation 
through audits. To implement our strategy 
effectively we segregated and monitored 
our waste processing across 8 broad and 45 
subcategories. Since proper segregation and 
categorization of waste into different categories 
is done before disposal, it helps Wipro to 
collaborate with authorized waste management 
service providers who possess the necessary 
licenses and permits to collect and dispose off 
waste safely and systematically adhering to 
predefined schedules and routes to optimize 
efficiency. 
During disposal, we ensure compliance with 
local laws and regulations. A concerned team 
is dedicated to managing and maintaining the 
site and regular inspections are done which help 
to identify any deviation and corrective actions 
are taken promptly to address non-compliance 
issues. 
The categorization of waste generated provides 
a holistic overview which in turn supports the 
organization in identifying opportunities for waste 
prevention and for adopting circularity measures. 
* Total Other Waste (incl. C&D) is 2900.37 tons and Total 
Waste generated (incl. C&D) is 5912.85 tons. 
Generation and segregation Wipro’s activities lead 
to generation of different types of waste which 
are categorized as follows. Total waste generated 
(including C&D) in this reporting year is 5913 tons 
which is an increase of 1435 tons compared to 
previous year due to increased occupancy levels.

Impact Valuation
Impact valuation is the quantifying and valuing of 
a company's positive and negative externalities 
in the context of society and the environment. It 
plays a pivotal role as a driver for value creation in 
the business.
The purpose of impact valuation is to identify 
the intended and unintended effects of business 
activities, across products and/or services, 
operations, and the supply chain. The process of 
accounting for positive and negative externalities 
systematically and thoroughly can help 
businesses make decisions that create value for 
all stakeholders – not just shareholders.
At Wipro, we have been calculating our 
Environmental Profit & Loss (EP&L) since 2016. 
Also referred to as Natural Capital Valuation, 
this exercise helps us assign a financial value 
to our natural capital. More recently, we also 
computed our Human Capital Valuation, which 
assesses the financial value of our impact on 
our employees, Social Capital Valuation, which 
evaluates the financial value of our influence on 
our communities, and Produced Capital Valuation, 
which evaluates the financial value of our 
produced goods and services.
Details on our FY24 impact valuation can be found 
on page 44 of Wipro's Integrated Annual Report
 FY 2023-24
Wipro’s position on Impact Valuation
Ever since the ‘Triple Bottomline Framework’ of 
People. Planet and Profits was enunciated in 
the late 1990s, the idea that a company exists 
to create shared value for all its stakeholders 
– not just its shareholders – has gripped the 
imagination of business practitioners and 
academic researchers alike. Stakeholders 
typically include customers, employees, suppliers, 
investors, communities, and governments.  
For example, for the employee as a stakeholder, 
the value created by a company is not only in 
terms of the salaries and benefits but equally 
important, a workplace that empowers the 
employee through continuous professional 
learning and by fostering a culture that is rooted 
in the values of diversity, equity, health, and well-
being. While few would argue with such a holistic 
approach how does one evaluate the extent of 
such value creation? Is there a way of measuring 
it? Should we even try to measure intangibles like 
well-being? 
While the last example concerns value creation, 
what about the opposite where a company dilutes 
or destroys value? British economist Arthur Pigou 
coined the term ‘externality’ around a century 
back to connote any cost (or benefit) borne by a 
group of people who have no control or say in the 
running of a company.  
The classic example is the deleterious impacts 
of pollution on communities originating in the 
company’s manufacturing processes. This was 
seen as an ethical anomaly since companies 
responsible for such pollution did not have to ‘pay’ 
for it or internalize it into its cost structure that 
would have otherwise reduced its profits. Pigou’s 
concept of externality eventually led to the 
‘polluter pays’ principle and the notion of ‘sin tax’ 
where products like tobacco were taxed at above 
marginal rates as they were seen as creating 
widespread negative externalities in society. 
In recent years though, the debate has shifted 
sharply to whether and how a company should 
measure the intangible, non-financial value it 
creates or destroys. It’s not difficult to see why 
this is tricky terrain e.g. is there a rigorous enough 
methodology to measure the whole range of 
ecosystem services forests provide – purifying air, 
conserving soil moisture, supporting pollinators, 
mitigating floods…not to speak of the material 
benefits of food, fiber and medicinal sources.  
These are not straightforward questions to 
answer especially if one has to consider second 
and third-order effects in spatial and temporal 
terms e.g. the beneficial effects of the Amazon 
rainforest are not just to proximate communities 
but to planetary health as a whole; an example is 
the correlation between the Amazon rainforest

and the rainfall pattern in Tibet. Despite such 
academic challenges, the last three decades 
have seen an ever-growing tribe of researchers 
drawn from Economics, Ecology, Sociology, Law, 
etc., grapple with methodological questions 
such as ‘What is the right discounting rate to be 
applied to the potential benefits or damage of an 
environmental action and which will manifest over 
decades to future generations?’ 
Back in 2016, we did our first assessment of our 
impacts on natural capital – in other words, we 
tried to measure the environmental externality 
on account of our operations and procurement 
processes. We published a summary of the results 
in something called the Environmental Profit 
& Loss statement (EP&L). We were probably 
one of the first few companies in the world to 
attempt such an exercise. Done in partnership 
with Trucost, a UK-based consulting firm, the 
methodology applied an econometric input-
output model wherein identified environmental 
and business metrics were used as proxy inputs 
to arrive at plausible monetary impacts.  
While we were aware of some inherent limitations 
of such techniques, we also recognized the 
important signaling value they carried internally 
and externally. Translating our environmental 
impacts into a common currency of business 
helped aid conversations with the company’s 
leadership and internal teams; a concrete 
example is the comparison EP&L provides across 
time periods on how we perform on different 
facets of environmental stewardship. Externally, 
it provides a basis for meaningful intra and 
inter-sectoral comparisons for researchers and 
analysts. For shareholders, the valuation of 
natural and social capital can be a useful leading 
indicator of a company’s exposure to physical and 
regulatory risks.  
Over the last 8 years, we have fine-tuned 
and refined our non-financial valuation in 
collaboration with GIST; we have included more 
environmental parameters – e.g. air pollution, and 
land use change – while introducing more recently 
the valuation of human, social, and produced 
capital. Our FY24 exercise, for example, shows 
that the total value of our environmental impacts 
is $ 270 Million which translates to intensity 
impacts of $25,000 per $ Million of Revenue and 
$160,000 per $ Million of EBIT; in other words, 
our environmental externalities add up to 2.5% of 
revenue and 16% of EBIT.  
Our journey so far has resulted in many interesting 
insights e.g. while our GHG footprint may seem 
significant, 2/3rds of our environmental footprint 
is due to air pollution. The typical reaction to this 
fact is one of puzzlement – how can an IT Services 
company be responsible for air pollution? The 
answer lies in the upstream pollution of thermal 
power stations which accounts for nearly 25% of 
our Indian electricity consumption; other factors 
include employee commute and business travel 
How do we see the road ahead? With a 
proliferation of global and national regulatory 
frameworks – ISSB, CSRD, BRSR in India – that 
seem to be tilting towards disclosing the financial 
materiality of factors like climate change, 
employee well-being, and customer solutions, we 
will see a concomitant increase in players in this 
space with an attendant expansion of scope and 
refinement of methodologies. This, we think, will 
result in cascading adoption cycles by more and 
more companies creating a virtuous feedback 
loop.  
At Wipro, we will continue to expand the range of 
stakeholder impacts we value – most importantly, 
this will include several determinants of positive 
value creation e.g. sustainability solutions for 
customers, employee well-being, and supplier 
diversity. We will therefore be able to present 
a more balanced picture of the impacts and 
externalities we create, whether positive or 
negative.  
It’s important though to adopt the Japanese 
concept of wabi-sabi when engaging with this 
space, i.e., it’s fine, in fact desirable, to have 
some degree of methodological imperfections 
when trying to measure the value of something as 
complex as nature and society. Impact valuation 
must be embedded in a bedrock of transparent 
and nuanced qualitative narratives; after all, 
as someone famously said ‘Not everything that 
matters can be measured and not everything that 
can be measured matters’.

Waste Tracking Mechanism  
With compliance monitoring and tracking, reports 
are generated to assess waste management 
performance which further aids in assessing the 
effectiveness of waste reduction initiatives and 
identifying the scope for improvement.  
Wipro’s target is to ensure that by 2025 more than 
98% of other categories of waste are recycled as 
per appropriate national standards with less than 
2% reaching landfills (excluding construction and 
demolition waste) and 100% of organic waste 
generated from business operations is recycled.  
Currently, 98% of our organic waste is composted. 
At the end of the financial year, 531.3 tonnes 
(Hazardous waste – 113.3 tons and Non-
Hazardous Waste – 418 tons) of waste was 
present onsite (in our operationally owned 
campuses. 
Wipro promotes waste reduction through various 
measures such as minimizing the use of single-
use plastics, promoting paperless operations, and 
adopting energy-efficient technologies. Wipro 
emphasizes recycling and encourages the use 
of recycled materials wherever feasible. Wipro 
collaborates with authorized recycling partners to 
manage electronic waste (e-waste) responsibly, 
ensuring compliance with relevant regulations. It 
has recently been tied up with a startup PadCare 
which facilitates proper disposal and recycling of 
sanitary waste through innovative technology.

Materiality
With climate emergency being more prevalent 
and more visible in the past decade, immediate 
and real climate action is becoming increasingly 
important. COP 28 emphasized the need to 
fast track efforts to limit global warming to 
1.5 deg C, while COP 28 did the first-ever ever 
“global stocktake” under the Paris Agreement. 
The stocktake revealed that progress across all 
climate action areas—from reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions to enhancing climate resilience and 
providing financial and technological support to 
vulnerable nations—was slow and inadequate. 
It becomes imperative, therefore, for all 
stakeholders (companies, countries and regions) 
to have a clear climate strategy that incorporates 
mitigation, adaptation and resilience.  
Wipro’s efforts in climate action comprises 
strategies to mitigate GHG emissions and to 
enhance business resilience.  This is informed 
by qualification of the impact of our business 
operations on global climate change and in turn 
its impact on our business. Our climate strategy 
aligns with the Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosure (TCFD).  
In determining the risks and opportunities of 
climate change with respect to the business, it 
is important to go through a double materiality 
exercise.  
Wipro conducted an extensive materiality exercise 
in 2023 to determine the key material issues. 
Through an elaborate stakeholder consultation 
and several focus group discussions with the 
leadership, we identified 25 key material topics 
across 8 themes. Details of our materiality 
exercise can be found on page 25 of this report. 
The 8 themes were further crystallized into 7 ESG 
Goals that are important for the organization. The 
progress against these goals is monitored by the 
Board on a quarterly basis.

Climate Risk
Looking at the other side of double materiality, 
Wipro recognizes that climate and ESG risks can 
affect a company’s operational strength and 
continuity. This has kept us vigilant in assessing 
our risks periodically. While a formal climate 
risk assessment exercise is carried out once 
in a few years, our Business Resilience team 
has implemented a comprehensive program to 
proactively assess risks, including our climate-
related risks and their associated impacts. These 
risks are integrated with our Business Resilience 
program to ensure business continuity.
Environmental stewardship and climate change 
emerged as one of the key material topics for the 
company, based on stakeholder engagement and 
leadership focus group discussions.  
Risk and Opportunity Assessment 
of our Material Topics
Governance of our Material Topics 
Every Function conducts a risk assessment on 
their material topics and chalks out mitigation 
measures to address the risk. These risks and 
mitigation plans are clearly defined in the 
Risk Register and monitored quarterly by the 
Enterprise Risk Management Team.  
Detailed description of the risks, mitigation 
measures and opportunities against each material 
topic is outlined in GRI 3.3. The responsibility 
matrix implemented for all ESG goals and material 
topic categories is shown on page page 28 and 29
Each of our material topics have a defined 
Function owner, who looks into the planning, 
implementation and monitoring of the goal.  
Every material topic is governed by one or more 
policies. A mapping of material topics to the 
relevant policies can be found on page 30
Functions play both mitigation and
adaptation roles as applicable (depicted below).
Risk Identification
The Enterprise Risk Management and 
Sustainability functions at Wipro oversee 
environmental and climate change related risk 
identification which is an internal part of a 
company-wide risk identification process.
The most important criteria considered for 
climate change risk identification are:
•	
Planning for Business Continuity (in the case 
of extreme weather events) 
•	
Energy and Water Scarcity accelerated by 
a gradual increase in average temperature 
and temperature ranges and precipitation 
variation 
•	
Health risks due to changes in temperature 
and related climate parameters
Risk identification and assessment at the 
company and asset level:
A well-defined Business Resilience Policy 
articulates the guidelines to be used to plan for 
climatic disruptions that could disrupt business 
objectives. The Business Resilience team governs 
and guides the standard risk assessment 
methodology at every location and helps identify 
risks that could potentially impact the continuity 
of business and related financial parameters 
like revenue and profitability, reputation, and 
legal parameters. This group collaborates with 
various support groups in the organization to 
assess risks for human resources, facilities 
and IT infrastructure with identified impacts, 
probability/likelihood and controls in place.

In addition to our ongoing process of risk 
assessment, a comprehensive climate risk 
assessment exercise was conducted in 2020, 
encompassing both physical and transitional 
risk which serves as a clarion call to action. 
Leveraging the IPCC-defined RCP 4.5 (The 
Optimistic Scenario) and RCP 8.5 (The Business-
As-Usual Scenario), the scenario-based 
assessment was conducted to evaluate medium 
to long-term effects (2030-2050) of acute 
(Increased severity and frequency of extreme 
weather events such as cyclones and floods) and 
chronic (Rising mean temperatures can impact 
health and well-being of employees) physical 
hazards.

are categorized under three key criteria as 
listed below, and are characterized as having 
a significant financial effect based on the 
description:
•	
People’s safety: The possible risk to the safety 
of 1,000 or more of our personnel at any given 
time in any area. We have estimated this to be 
0.5% of staff in specific cities. 
•	
Wipro’s infrastructure: The need for relocation 
of more than 25% of personnel to other sites, 
as well as a 10% increase in infrastructure 
costs due to possible damage.
•	
Customer delivery: Possible impacts on a 
customer engagement by more than 25% 
of the relationship value. Furthermore, any 
mission-critical service would have to be 
restored within the time frame agreed upon 
with clients.
Combined with the likelihood of risk occurrence, 
risks were categorized into high, medium and low.

Risk Resilience (Adaptation) 
Actionable Insights and Future Plans 
Wipro has a well-defined Business Resilience 
Policy to plan for any contingency through the 
implementation of a robust Business Continuity 
Management System (BCMS). Climate-related 
disruptions are a part of the business risks, and 
the BCMS takes into consideration disruptions 
that may result from climate-related natural 
disasters.  
The Business Resilience team implements a 
comprehensive Threat Management Program that 
enhances its resilience posture across global 
delivery locations. The program addresses five key 
threat categories: Environmental, Technological 
Infrastructure, Operational, Geopolitical and 
Security, and Workforce Disruptions.
Key Features
•	
Bottom-up approach to identify vulnerabilities 
and develop risk response strategies
•	
Continuous monitoring of threats
•	
Focus on critical locations and single-points-
of-failure
The process followed is as follows:
•	
Identification and rating of risk 
•	
Assessing the impact of the risk on business 
continuity 
•	
Formulating a Business Continuity Plan/ 
Business Resilience Plan. These plans are 
made at the (i) Account level (to address 
recovery of critical business processes for 
the customer service delivery), (ii) Service 
Function level (to address recovery of critical 
business processes of the service function); 
and (iii) Location level (to address immediate 
emergency response and also integrate 
recovery of critical business processes for 
various accounts and service functions at the 
location)
Outcomes and Impact
•	
 Improved business continuity posture through 
identification of critical risks 
•	
Enhanced decision-making capabilities based 
on actionable insights 
•	
Strengthened stakeholder collaboration via 
workshops and engagement initiatives 
The next round of climate risk assessment across 
all our facilities is being planned later this year. 
Armed with our current knowledge and process, 
this risk assessment exercise will be more 
rigorous. In addition to risk intensity, the proposed 
plan is to assess site-wise preparedness to 
arrive at an overall risk score. Further, actual 
impacts on employees and business, with a 
focus on employee health and absenteeism, 
will be assessed to obtain actionable insights. 
We also plan to initiate an academic exercise 
to understand the impacts of climate-related 
natural disasters on employee health and 
productivity, to better nuance the impacts on 
business.
The program demonstrates Wipro’s commitment 
to proactive risk management, operational 
resilience, and sustainable growth.  
By systematically addressing potential threats, 
Wipro ensures its ability to maintain service 
continuity for clients while safeguarding its 
workforce and assets.
Case Study
During the 2023 flood and cyclonic events in Chennai, 
the Crisis management (CM) team took control for 
effective response, recovery and resumption from the 
situation. Early detection of forecasted rains helped 
in initiating CM protocol before the crisis. Account / 
Service function and location level business continuity 
plans were invoked. Recovery strategies like  work 
from home, relocation to alternate sites and onshore 
support through resiliency were implemented for 
customer accounts.

Climate Action 
(Mitigation) 
Targets for Operations and Value Chain  
Since 2007, we have had an unequivocal 
commitment to environmental sustainability, 
under which climate change, water, biodiversity, 
and waste management have been key focus 
areas.  
Our Net Zero Targets, validated by SBTi, are:
•	
Net Zero on Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions           
by 2040  
•	
59% reduction of Scope 1 and 2 by 2030 
•	
55% reduction of Scope 3 by 2030 
•	
In addition, we have also committed to     
RE100 - 100% renewable energy - by 2030.
Our climate action is governed by our Energy and 
Environmental Policy. At the core of our climate 
action initiatives is decarbonization which 
revolves around Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Energy Transition. Our efforts around energy 
efficiency are outlined in the Environmental 
section of this report (page 40). Our transition 
to renewable energy began several years ago. 
Today, our operationally controlled facilities are 
powered by 76% renewable energy procured 
through multiple types of arrangements available 
in the market, e.g., Group captive. As a result, our 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions have reduced by 80% 
with respect to our FY2017 baseline, significantly 
ahead of our near-term 2030 targets.
We have also been measuring and baselining 
emissions on account of our value chain. As 
we fine-tune our measurement methodologies 
for Scope 3, it helps feed into our mitigation 
strategies as outlined on page 79 of the Wipro's 
Integrated Annual Report FY2023-24.
Implementation of the mitigation plans is 
embedded and distributed among the multiple 
functions within the organization while the overall 
governance is with the Sustainability team.
Net Zero vs Carbon Neutral
The ongoing debate of Net Zero vs Carbon 
Neutrality continues even as SBTi faced a 
backlash for introducing carbon credits to the 
program, having to rescind it almost immediately. 
To understand what the fuss is all about, it is 
important to understand these terms better. 
Though achieving Net Zero and Carbon Neutrality 
has the same end goal of mitigating climate 
change, the mechanisms by which they go about it 
is very different.
Carbon Neutrality is achieved by balancing 
carbon sequestration with carbon emissions. 
Technically, this could mean that as long as there 
are enough carbon sinks, the absolute quantum 
of carbon emissions need not reduce. There are 
two observations with this - the measurement of 
carbon sink capacity should be fool-proof in order 
to claim carbon neutrality; and more importantly, 
it could set an undesirable precedent that 
internal decarbonization may be perceived to be 
unnecessary.
Net Zero, on the other hand, focuses on direct 
decarbonization to reduce the absolute emissions 
until the point it can no longer be done, post 
which carbon offsets could be relied upon. SBTi, 
for example, endorses targets that support 
limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees 
Celsius, as agreed in the 2015 Paris Climate 
Summit. It allows offsets only for the residual, last 
10% of an organization’s footprint and that too, 
only from the target year onwards. The reliance on 
direct decarbonization reflects a commitment to 
an absolute reduction of emissions, which could 
help achieve our global goals faster.

Collaborating with our Value Chain
Actionable Insights and Future Plans
As part of the ESG Goals and Targets that get 
reviewed by the Board every quarter, we have 
a goal to reduce our delivery emissions for our 
top customer accounts by 50% by 2030. The 
first step to do this is to establish a baseline. 
We have created a “Considered Delivery Impact” 
calculator to measure the footprint contribution 
of programs/ teams, and are in the process of 
deploying this among our clients, and reviewing 
quarterly. This is elaborated on page 59 of the 
Wipro's Integrated Annual Report FY2023-24.
In parallel, we are actively engaging with our 
supply chain through the CDP Supply Chain 
Platform as well as an internal program called 
WISE (Wipro Initiative for Supplier Engagement). 
Through these programs, we intend to work 
As our Net Zero program matures, we are working 
toward achieving more granularity and accuracy 
in our measurement of Scope 3 emissions in 
account of our Purchased Goods and Services, 
Business Travel and Employee Commute 
categories. As our office occupancy and travel 
numbers steadily increase, it becomes imperative 
that we introduce new processes and policies to 
lower emission levels. To decarbonize our supply 
chain, we follow an inside-out approach to set the 
right processes and policies.

(i) Lag in adoption of energy-efficient equipment retrofits in older 
buildings, lag in adoption of latest energy efficiency technologies, 
lag in adoption of renewable energy, adoption of electric vehicles 
without adequate charging infrastructure, inability to anticipate 
climate-induced risks to water and the consequent gaps in 
adoption of higher quality water treatment technologies.  
(ii) Inability to take advantage of the emerging markets for digital 
solutions for climate change solutions.
Legal
We have a proactive approach in managing and complying with 
emerging and current regulations and commitment to sustainability. 
Hence, we have not faced nor do we anticipate any legal risks. 
Market

Financial Impact of Climate Risks
We have made the following assumptions while 
calculating the financial impact over five years
(FY23-24 to FY27-28)
(a) +7% annual increase in cost of electricity 
(b) -2% reduction of total electricity consumption 
due to energy conservation measures. 
(c) +7% increase in cost of sales (CoS)
The total financial impact estimated due to 
increase in fuel/electricity price is within the 
range of $55.7 to 68.1 million. This is offset by 2% 
reduction in energy consumption ($1 million) due 
to energy efficiency programs. 
Further, $1.72 million of cost is added based on 
assumption that Government of India mandates 
5% RPO every year. Therefore, the net financial 
impact due to this is $ 62 million) for a five-year 
period.
Our plan to manage the risk from increase in fuel 
and electricity prices is two-fold:
(a) Demand side management, where we improve 
energy efficiency through initiatives like HVAC 
Plant retrofits, Group Captive Investments, Energy 
Optimization, etc. We have estimated the cost of 
such initiatives to be $11.7 million for a five year 
period.
(b) Scale up Renewable Energy procurement 
through open access or group captive channels 
at lower relative costs from 75 million units to 
110 million units by 2030. During FY 2023-24, RE 
contributed 76% of our total energy consumption.
We estimate a total additional cost of $40.53 
million over the next five years on account 
of additional energy procurement, server 
virtualization, revamp of building management 
systems, running of global energy command 
center (GECC) and retrofits to significantly 
improve efficiency - for example, electronically 
commutated fans for Air Handling Units (AHU) in 
buildings are 30-40% more energy efficient. Also 
the cost is inclusive of $27.34 million due to the 
green platinum-rated buildings.

Women
At the core of Wipro’s powerful legacy is its 
values. Our commitment to our Five Habits and 
the Spirit of Wipro guides us and forms the 
foundation for our transformation and evolution. 
At the heart of this is our belief that people are 
our greatest asset. We strive to make a difference 
in the lives of our employees, customers, 
partners, and the communities in which we 
live and work. As we undergo a fundamental 
transformation journey, our priority is to nurture 
what makes Wipro, Wipro: our employees.  
Over the course of the years, we have examined 
our policies and processes more closely to make 
them even more people-centric. The changes 
the world has seen and will continue to see have 
changed the way we work, and we are committed 
to creating a workplace that reflects our 
contemporary society.  
Around the world, Wiproites have returned to the 
office to build networks, celebrate successes, 
and access learning opportunities together. 
Our hybrid work model offers the flexibility of 
remote work combined with the collaboration 
and advantages of working together in the office. 
We have launched initiatives to promote in-
person connections, networking, collaboration, 
learning, celebration, and growth. Our employee 
engagement activities aim to cultivate a 
positive work culture, uplift morale, and boost 
productivity.
Inclusion is a way of life at Wipro. We integrate 
diversity into everyday work, encouraging all 
Wiproites to be their authentic selves, at all times. 
We are committed to equitable practices, to 
offering equal opportunities to all, and embracing 
all forms of differences. This core value of 
inclusion and equity allows us to be an employer 
of choice that attracts, and grows, diverse 
talent. At Wipro, we are committed to fostering 
a workplace where individuals, regardless of 
their gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, 
racial or ethnic background, and generations, are 
valued not in silos but as unique intersections of 
multifaceted identities. Through this approach, 
we aim to promote equity, respect, and a sense of 
belonging for all.
Our approach towards women is based on the 
unique life-stage philosophy inherent in our 
Women of Wipro (WoW) framework. Our WoW 
programs have been tailored and customized to 
cater to the needs of women at every stage of 
their lives and work; they are not a one-size-fits-
all approach. The framework structures Wipro’s 
internal policies, processes, and initiatives to 
promote inclusion and empowerment of women.

policies and practices foster an inclusive work 
environment at Wipro.  
Begin Again is our program focused on hiring 
women who have taken a break from their 
careers. The program was featured in the 
NASSCOM-IIM Ahmedabad Report on Returnship 
Programs.
Shared below are some of the initiatives that 
underscore our commitment to Women:
Increased Representation of Women in Senior 
Leadership
We use a holistic approach to increase the 
representation of women in senior leadership 
through focused hiring efforts and building 
a strong pipeline of leaders. Our structured 
governance, continued commitment, and 
drive from leaders have resulted in women’s 
representation at the senior leadership level 
increasing from 7.3% in FY21 to 18.7% in FY24.
We are actively working to increase women’s 
representation in decision-making roles.
Currently, 22.2% of our Board of Directors, 20.0% 
of the Wipro Executive Board , and 22.6% of the 
Wipro Executive Committee are women.
Key Programs and Initiatives 
Enrich: A sponsorship program for high-potential 
senior women leaders, to strengthen the talent 
pipeline and create an ecosystem of enablement. 
Two cohorts of the program have graduated, and 
the program has been a success following which 
our next cohort has seen a two-fold increase in 
participation.
Begin Again: A program for women who want to 
restart their careers after a hiatus, whether it's 
due to a sabbatical, parenthood, senior care, 
travel, pursuing a passion, or any other cause.
WoW Mom: A program that aims to support, 
enable, and engage with women employees 
proceeding for or returning from maternity leave. 
It comprises policies to support employees, 
encourage pre-maternity connections and 
HR connections with mothers returning from 
maternity leave. We also offer a WoW Mom 
handbook, information on daycare facilities, 
lactation facilities and more. 
Our holistic policy ensures a smoother integration 
for our returning mothers and helps support them 
as they take on new responsibilities and new 
adjustments in their lives. We also run a quarterly 
survey for returning mothers to solicit their input. 
We have Leadership Connects and sessions for 
returning mothers on various topics. This program 
is customized based on geography. 
We have implemented e-learning modules to 
support maternity management in the workplace. 
One module is designed for women associates, 
while the other is tailored for managers. These 
modules provide step-by-step guidance from 
the announcement of pregnancy, through the 
maternity leave period, the transition back to 
work, and beyond.
Other Programs: Our flagship capability programs 
such as Your Career Your Choice and She Leads 
help women stay competitive and tackle 
workplace challenges. The voices of women 
leaders are heard through quarterly discussions 
with our CEO and the Wipro Executive Board 
through a W-Connect Forum.

At Wipro, we are committed to creating an 
inclusive and accessible workplace for all 
colleagues, including those with disabilities, 
chronic medical conditions, and primary 
caregivers to dependents with disabilities. We 
align our efforts with the CREATE framework 
(Career, Recruit, Engage, Accessibility, Train, and 
Enable) to implement initiatives such as hiring, 
redeployment, engagement through accessibility 
improvements. We plan to expand our disability 
charter to include neurodiversity hiring and 
continue strengthening our accessibility 
charter. Our efforts have led to increased self-
identification among colleagues with disabilities, 
participation in observances and campaigns 
throughout the year, and recognition from 
Forbes and NASSCOM. We've enabled over 
1200+ reasonable accommodation requests 
and enhanced policies and benefits to ensure 
inclusion of our colleagues. Our external advocacy 
includes participation in round tables with leading 
organizations, demonstrating our commitment to 
holistic diversity, equity and inclusion.
The Black Alliance ERG strives to promote a 
diverse and inclusive work environment, with a 
focus on Black and African-American employees. 
We established and observed an additional 
holiday in the US on Martin Luther King Day. 
Efforts to raise awareness about Wipro with 
students attending historically Black colleges and 
universities (HBCUs) by partnering with a local 
fraternity are also ongoing. Our first Juneteenth 
event focuses on increasing knowledge about 
Juneteenth. We commemorate Black History 
Month throughout February.
There are also regional and country-specific 
chapters along with affinity groups for Hispanic 
and Latin/o/a/x employees and allies, Asian and 
Pacific Islander employees and allies, etc.
Through organization-wide global campaigns, we 
observe and celebrate International Women’s Day, 
International Day of Women and Girls in Science, 
Black History Month, International Day of Persons 
with Disabilities, Cognitive Diversity, Pride 
Month, Transgender Awareness Week, Human 
Rights Day, and other important days recognized 
by the United Nations. The campaigns include 
virtual events, panel discussions, sessions for 
employees, messages from leaders, employee 
stories, and social media posts.  Other campaigns 
cover themes like sign language, allyship, 
neurodiversity, cultural diversity, mental health, 
and parenthood.
By raising awareness, developing a strong 
network of allies, and implementing policy 
reforms, we are creating a safe workplace for 
LGBTQ+ employees. To be all-inclusive, we 
constantly examine, amend, and add new features 
to our policies and processes to make them more 
inclusive. 
Wipro Pride is an employee resource group (ERG) 
that helps employees share important information 
and best practices, network with other LGBTQ+ 
colleagues and allies, start conversations, and 
more. We have a Global Prevention of LGBTQ+ 
Discrimination Policy to protect our employees 
from bias and discrimination based on their 
gender identity or sexual orientation. In many 
countries, Wipro’s insurance policy covers 
gender-affirming or transition surgery and related 
medical procedures.

Our Associates are our greatest strength and 
we aim to build exceptional teams from diverse 
backgrounds to allow us to drive success and set 
high standards for innovation. Our culture and 
values have always provided us with a strong 
foundation to create an industry-leading Talent 
Attraction Model.
 
We have leveraged this model to attract, identify 
and hire diverse top talent across the organization 
at all levels. We have provided early career hires 
with a sustainable platform to grow and shape 
themselves into technology leaders of tomorrow. 
We have also focused on creating and launching 
an Employer Value Proposition (EVP) this year to 
market the right jobs to the right lateral hires to 
build strength in the organization and to hire the 
best leaders for experienced roles. 
Improving candidate experience has also been a 
top priority and we have seen this focus pay off 
in our Glassdoor ratings, where 70% have voted 
to recommend Wipro to a friend. Diversity and 
inclusion has been rated as the highest quality for 
Wipro at Glassdoor. 
We have also seen our highest-ever rating on 
Indeed where we have been rated 3.8 out of 
16,000+ reviews. Technology and automation have 
been at the forefront of our hiring practices and 
this has helped us make quick and data-backed 
hiring decisions. We have also created flagship 
programs such as “Begin Again” to further our 
commitment to diversity and inclusion.
In line with our strategic priorities, our talent 
management processes drive high performance 
across the organization. Leaders play a key 
role in setting ambitious business plans and 
leading their teams to meet those goals. They 
demonstrate accountability towards outcomes for 
themselves and their teams. 
Our talent differentiation is sharp and based 
on outcomes. Performance differentiation is 
enabled by clear rating definitions, which require 
high performance. Rewards are closely linked to 
performance outcomes. Career growth is based on 
sustained high performance.
 
We believe values and performance must go hand 
in hand. We consider our Five Habits as our values 
in action. We have a bi-annual appraisal process 
and encourage real-time feedback throughout the 
year to make job growth and learning an ongoing 
process, not a once-a-year meeting. The annual 
review process enables fairness and objectivity by 
considering holistic feedback throughout the year.
Career building is an important pillar of our 
employee value proposition. Our promotion and 
rotation policies have been strengthened to 
ensure more employees can take new roles and 
build the careers they seek. To ensure talented 
and capable employees have adequate growth 
opportunities, we have doubled and sustained the 
frequency of promotions at junior and mid-career 
levels. 
Management by Objectives: The goals and 
objectives are set by associates at the beginning 
of the year based on the discussion with 
their manager. The account/unit objectives 
are cascaded to the role incumbents by the 
respective managers ensuring alignment with the 
overall organizational objectives. Role holders can 
modify their goals and objective if needed, during 
the year as well.
Multidimensional Performance Appraisal: The 
individual's performance is evaluated based 
on the outcomes achieved by them against the 
goals and objectives set. The evaluation is basis 
holistic review of their performance considering 
the inputs from their additional managers and 
reporting managers.

Team-Based Appraisal : There is an annual 
360-degree feedback survey where employees 
in senior-level roles receive feedback from their 
teams, peers, internal customers, managers, and 
external customers. At Wipro, succession planning 
is a bi-annual exercise. Talent is grouped in terms 
of performance and potential; successors are 
identified for critical roles and development 
actions are framed. Executive coaching is 
provided to senior leaders to facilitate their 
holistic development. The process helps identify 
top talent across the organization, with a clear 
focus on diverse talent that we can engage and 
train to assume leadership roles in the future, 
creating a robust and agile leadership pipeline, 
and delivering improved business results.
Agile Conversations: Under our ‘Feed-Forward’ 
initiative, managers have access to real-time 
inputs with team members whether it is shout-
out for a job well done or constructive inputs on 
the performance against goals and objectives. 
The comments from the managers (including all 
managers the individual had worked with) ensure 
holistic reviews of the individual's performance 
during the mid-year and year-end appraisal 
cycles.

Well-being is a pillar of our cultural framework. 
We are advocates of well-being and focus on 
the holistic Well-being and good health of all 
our permanent employees. Beyond providing for 
professional growth, we believe every individual 
must invest in personal fulfillment and fun. 
Wipro Well-being is a journey to help each of us 
feel well and have the energy to live the life we 
want by connecting the three important aspects 
of our lives: Mind, Body, and Community. We 
adopted a data-driven approach to healthcare 
that makes it sustainable, scalable, and unique. 
This also includes a holistic well-being platform 
with offerings for health and wellness across 
geographies aligned to the three-point plan 
toward employees’ well-being, connecting mind, 
body, and community. 
Leaders define the ecosystem within which their 
teams operate. Hence leadership involvement in  
well-being is a key area of focus. A leader sponsor 
has been identified for well-being at Wipro. The 
role of the leader sponsor is to normalize well-
being conversations and socialize well-being 
interventions. 
The 3-Point Plan: Well-being is connected to every 
aspect of our lives and is the sum of how we feel 
in mind, body, and our communities. When we find 
meaning in our work, it energizes our personal 
lives. When our relationships are fulfilling, we 
are in harmony with our communities. When our 
communities are supported and sustainable, so 
is our planet. And it all begins with feeling well. 
Wipro Well-being is designed to help us find the 
habits, activities, and approaches we need to 
succeed and thrive. 
The three-point plan is a set of programs and 
tools -- from healthcare to fitness challenges, 
webinars to support groups, self-help guides to 
volunteering opportunities -- designed to help 
employees build individualized three-point plans 
for themselves and their families. These include:
•	
Mind: From time to time everybody needs 
some space, a break, professional help or 
Stress Management
•	
EAP Counseling - Available to all employees 
globally, free of cost. 24*7 support from 
certified counselors through phone or emails.
•	
Resources (articles, videos, and self-help 
courses) to assist employees in making 
informed choices on their well-being, 
available via digital well-being platforms. 
We also have the HMM-SPARK portal which 
can be accessed by all employees. There 
are learning pathways for various skills. The 
learning elements on this portal are in the 
form of articles, podcasts, videos, and courses 
curated by Harvard experts.
•	
Redressal platforms for employees - We 
encourage safe workplaces by offering 
platforms for the redressal and grievances 
through Ombuds and Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment. We have yearly certification 
on the prevention of sexual harassment and 
ombuds for all employees.
•	
Behavior spotting - Psychological first aid 
program designed for leaders, specifically the 
Front-Line Managers (FLMs), to be equipped 
with skills to recognize any early signs of 
psychological distress and align strategies in 
place to support their affected team members. 
Employee Well-being and 
Support Programs
a “digital detox.”. Wipro Well-being offers a 
structured program that ranges from leave 
days to self-help to confidential counselling. 
•	
Body: Physical health is the most visible 
part of how we feel. Wipro counseling offers 
not only medical coverage, but also fitness 
training, a range of sessions and expert panels 
designed to help employees sleep and eat 
better, get fit, build healthy habits, and more.  
•	
Community: Being involved in a community 
and nurturing a sense of belonging is essential 
to overall well-being. Wipro Well-being offers 
volunteering opportunities, causes, support 
groups and other ways to reach out the way 
most meaningful to each employee.

Sports and Health 
•	
Fitness and Recreation - We have gyms and 
recreational facilities in office campuses 
across locations. This is free for all Wipro 
employees.
•	
Annual Health checks- Wipro encourages all 
employees to go through a health check. It 
is sponsored by the company globally. The 
Health check is sponsored once every year by 
the company to encourage healthy lifestyles.
•	
Free, unlimited consultations with general 
practitioners, and discounted rates for 
specialists in several countries with free 
specialist consults based on monthly well-
being themes.
•	
Rejuvenation leaves- To enable work-
life balance and encourage employees to 
take time off for self/family time, we have 
introduced this leave over and above existing 
leaves in some geographies.
•	
Capability Building Modules in Mental Well-
being (Gear Up) – An expert-curated online 
well-being module to help learners strengthen 
their mental resilience. The module enables 
learners to navigate through stressful 
situations effectively with the aid of easy-to-
master tools that they can implement in their 
daily lives. This will be followed by courses 
focusing on building capability in managers to 
identify and manage signs of distress among 
team members.
•	
Health education is digitally available 24/7 in 
our well-being platforms and every day as mail 
nuggets to all employees.
Additionally, we provide the below key benefits to 
ensure employees can strike a positive work-life 
balance in all that they do:
Hybrid Work and Flexible Working:  Wipro’s 
Hybrid Work Policy guidelines give employees 
the flexibility to work remotely (outside of 
their assigned office) while supporting Wipro’s 
commitment to collaboration, innovation, and 
productivity.
Parental Leave: Globally, Wipro commits to 
provide 12 weeks of paid maternity leave to 
female employees; five days of paid leave to 
male employees/secondary caregivers to be 
used within the first 90 days after childbirth, 
and four weeks of paid leave for adoption/
surrogacy. Parents also have the option of the 
extended parental leave (90 days on an unpaid 
basis) to care for and bond with a newborn child. 
Previously, extended leave after childbirth was 
only available to women; In FY23 we included 
new fathers under the policy to enable them to 
take extended parental leave for 90 days anytime 
within the first year after childbirth. If  the local 
legislative standards are more beneficial, those 
standards would apply. 
Lactation and Day-care Facilities: Additionally, 
we also have day care and breast-feeding/
lactation facilities for all our full-time and 
contract employees in India. At present, we have 
10 on-campus day care centers and affiliations 
with more than 100 centers across India.
Insurance: All permanent employees in India are 
covered under medical and accident insurance 
policies. These benefits are also provided to 
employees across geographies consistent with 
applicable laws in each jurisdiction.
 
Compensation and Benefits Approach: We 
provide employees with compensation packages 
commensurate with their skills, experience, 
and local laws and regulations. Salaries are 
determined by the markets we serve and the cost 
of living in a particular geography.

OHS Risk Assessment 
Wipro has established, implemented and 
maintained a Risk Assessment procedure 
(Procedure Hazard Identification, Risk 
Assessment and Control) for ongoing hazard 
identification, risk assessment and determination 
of necessary controls. The procedure has 
considered all the requirements of the ISO 
45001:2018 and ISO 14001 Standard. Procedure 
Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and 
Control includes the requirement to complete 
risk assessment in consultation with relevant 
personnel and where applicable, include the 
health and safety representative for that area. 
The risk of hazards shall be assessed including 
consideration of controls – using likelihood 
and severity and the hierarchy of controls will 
be applied to reduce the risk to a level that is 
‘acceptable’ according to the acceptance criteria 
specified and internally derived. Quarterly safety 
committee meetings are conducted.
Occupational Safety and Health
Vendor works, snakes in the campus and 
transport are some incidences that have 
contributed to high- consequences injuries
Independent External Verification
All our operationally-controlled sites have 
undergone a comprehensive audit of our 
employee health and safety risk assessment, 
identifying, and mitigating potential hazards to 
provide a safe and healthy work environment for 
all employees.  100% of our sites are certified 
with ISO 45001, demonstrating our commitment 
to the well-being of our workforce, fostering a 
culture of safety, and maintaining compliance 
with regulatory requirements.
Procedure to Investigate Work Related 
Injuries, Ill health, Diseases and Incidents
Wipro has established, implemented and 
maintains a process to report, investigate 
and manage incidents and non-conformities. 
Proactive reporting for unsafe conditions 
and unsafe acts are captured and corrective 
actions are derived. Reactive indicators like 
dangerous occurrences, near misses, first aid, 
minor and major injuries are investigated and 
corrective action is undertaken. The learnings are 
implemented across the organization.  
OHS Training
Employees working on behalf or under the 
control of Wipro in the areas where significant 
aspects/hazards have been identified and 
are trained to build competency for handling 
the significant aspects/hazards. Core team 
members of the department within the scope of 
EHS shall be responsible for assuring that the 
appropriate training, awareness, and competence 
requirements have been defined and met. The 
associated records of competency are retained by 
the MR as relevant for fulfilling the requirement of 
competency. EHS induction module is introduced 
to train all new joiners to make them understand 
the requirements. We have provided EHS 
E-Learning (Wi Learn) programs for employees 
to educate and empower all employees with 
the knowledge and skills necessary to identify 
and manage health and safety risks, as well as 
adopt good working practices. Every employee is 
required to undergo this training yearly.
Our integrated benefits program provides a range 
of options for better financial and social security, 
including efficient tax-management options, life 
and accident insurance, and medical coverage. 
Additionally, periodic webinars are conducted 
to raise awareness on financial planning, 
investments, and more. 
We provide long-term incentives for employees in 
senior leadership positions by granting restricted 
stock units and performance stock units. These 
plans are designed to motivate and retain key 
leaders. We continue to drive a high-performance 
and growth-oriented culture through our variable 
pay programs. Our management compensation 
is closely aligned with organizational objectives 
and priorities and rewards consistent high 
performance. 
We also conduct monthly audits of all labor 
standards for all full-time and part-time 
employees. To ensure all our value chain partners 
are remitting statutory dues to employees and the 
authorities regularly, we conduct regular audits of 
all third-party vendors using internal and external 
resources.

Employee Experience Survey (EES) and 
Employee Insights 
Employee Engagement Survey (EES) is a 
purposefully designed active listening mechanism 
to understand employee engagement and 
various drivers leading to engagement at 
the organizational level. Covering the entire 
employee lifecycle, the survey gauges the overall 
engagement and satisfaction on aspects such as 
career, work-life balance, enabling environment, 
and more. 
Here are the key highlights from the EES: 
•	
Employee engagement at 83% (with 75% 
participation). Engagement score is reported 
as a combination of job satisfaction (80%), 
purpose (91%) and willingness to recommend 
(79%): Wipro continues to lead benchmark of 
Fortune 500 companies, and IT / Professional 
Services organizations.
•	
The survey also touches upon 20 engagement 
drivers, some of them being well-being/ 
happiness (79%), psychological safety 
(84%), diversity and inclusion, transparent 
communication, work-life balance (82%), role 
fit, trust in manager and leadership, etc.
Wipro is leading benchmarks of Fortune  
500 companies, IT / Professional Services 
organizations.

Some actions that we have taken based on the 
feedback:
•	
A culture of self-service is being built with 
The Dot (our employee experience platform) 
to make information (resources, applications, 
tools) available to enhance productivity and 
build engagement. WiNow (our AI chatpod) 
has assisted over 214K unique associates, in 
the flow of work with 80% internal customer 
favorability, addressing ~15K queries per day.
•	
Reimagination of onboarding has led to 97% 
favorability on Day 1 and 89.3% favorability on 
day 90 amongst new hires. 
•	
Simplification of associate travel with 
self-service is live in 23 countries and is 
being expanded across all countries, while 
simultaneously simplifying policies to make 
reimbursements easy to claim and process, 
simplifying business travel.
•	
Digital ecosystems are being leveraged to 
quicken background verification and faster 
onboarding. Technology is being used to 
verify claim submissions, and management 
of associate leave and attendance, toward 
superior compliance. 
•	
(Internal) customer satisfaction of queries 
addressed by people operations has seen 
a 20% increase with structural changes, 
simplification, and operational focus on turn-
around time and training of associates.
•	
Our CEO has committed to quarterly 
leadership connects. All SMU (Strategic 
Market Units) CEOs  and GBL (Global Business 
Lines) leaders will conduct quarterly town 
halls and allow asking questions to the 
associates.
Human Rights and Values at Wipro
Commitment to Human Rights
Wipro is committed to protecting and respecting 
human rights and remedying rights violations 
as they are identified. These include issues 
relating to human trafficking, forced labor, 
child labor, freedom of association, the right to 
collective bargaining, equal remuneration and 
discrimination. 
Providing equal employment opportunities, 
ensuring distributive, procedural, and 
interactional fairness in all what we do, creating 
a harassment-free, safe environment and 
respecting one’s fundamental rights are some 
of the ways in which we ensure the protection of 
human rights. 
As an equal opportunity employer, we do not 
discriminate based on race, ethnicity, color, 
religion, sex, national origin, gender identity, 
gender expression, sexual orientation or disability. 
Our Code of Business Conduct (COBC), Supplier 
Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy are 
aligned to globally accepted standards and 
frameworks like the U.N. Global Compact, U.N. 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
International Labour Organization’s Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (ILO 
Declaration). They cover all employees, suppliers, 
clients, communities and countries across 
geographies where we do business. Wipro is also 
one of the founding members of CII’s Business for 
Human Rights Initiative.
Freedom of Association
We respect the right of employees to freely 
associate without fear of reprisal, discrimination, 
intimidation or harassment. Our employees are 
represented by formal employee representative 
groups in certain geographies including 
Continental Europe and Latin America, which 
allow asking agreements. Our HR representatives 
ensure legislative awareness and compliance 
and meet these groups periodically to inform and 
consult on any changes that might impact their 
terms and conditions of employment and/or their 
work environment.
Risk Identification Process
We have established committees and processes 
like the Ombuds, Prevention of Sexual

Mitigation Policies and Processes
We have created specific interventions to address 
these identified risks:
•	
A level playing field across key pillars of 
diversity specifically for employees with 
disabilities and for members of the LGBTQ+ 
community: 
•	
Inclusion champions and allies in the 
business have been trained to conduct 
awareness sessions for employees across 
units. These sessions cover themes like 
understanding gender and sexual orientation, 
inclusive language and behavior at the 
workplace, becoming an ally, and others. 
 
•	
Wiproites can declare a same-sex partner 
under family details and under our medical 
insurance policy and cover their registered 
partners. We have an LGBTQ+ handbook 
that acts as an important reference 
and aids in understanding the LGBTQ+ 
community. 
•	
To foster inclusion of colleagues with 
disabilities, we have developed in-house 
awareness modules and workshops on 
topics such as inclusive procurement, 
digital accessibility plus Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 standards, 
inclusive recruitment, and more. 
 
•	
Customized workshops are conducted 
periodically to raise awareness and 
help employees learn more about non-
discrimination, accessible workplaces, 
communicating in sign language, 
awareness on reasonable accommodation, 
and workplace solutions to strengthen 
inclusivity.
•	
Contract Employee Engagement:  We engage 
contract employees to support our projects 
in India Business on short-term assignments. 
The duration of such engagements varies 
depending on the project and the role. We 
ensure the parent organizations provide 
medical insurance coverage along with Group 
Life Insurance, for employees. We drive internal 
mandatory trainings (Code of Business Conduct, 
Information Security Awareness Course and 
Code of Operations Conduct). We also ensure 
background verification is carried out for these 
employees through the HRSS Team. We conduct 
open houses along with “rest and relaxation” 
sessions for synergy employees deployed in 
Indian business units. 
•	
Awareness of Unconscious Bias: At Wipro, 
we encourage each one of us to break the 
biases. For many years now, we have had an 
e-learning module on unconscious bias for all 
employees to deepen their understanding of 
the subject. More than 1,82,500 employees 
have completed the module. 
We also run global communication campaigns 
to raise awareness and drive behavioural 
changes. Helping our employees thrive, 
achieve their full potential, and bring value 
to our clients begins with our managers and 
leaders. Our people managers go through 
inclusive leadership programs to help ensure 
that we are actively mitigating the impact of 
potential bias and help build more diverse and 
inclusive teams.
Harassment Committee, Employee Experience 
Survey, Audit/Risk and Compliance committees, 
EHS, an Inclusion and Diversity Council and 
Culture Council to review progress and formulate 
strategies to address issues pertaining to 
compliance, safety and a harassment-free 
workplace. 
These processes are periodically reviewed by 
the top management. We keep our employees 
informed about these processes regularly through 
trainings, mailers and internal social media 
platforms. The human rights requirements form 
part of our business agreements and contracts. 
Also, a detailed due diligence is done before each 
merger or acquisition which outlines compliance 
and governance risks.
Identified Risks
Through various projects, audits, and feedback, 
we have identified the following as potential risks 
to human rights, as key areas of focus:
•	
A level playing field across key pillars of 
diversity, specifically for employees with 
disabilities and for members of the LGBTQ+ 
community 
•	
Contract employee engagement
•	
Eliminate unconscious bias at the workplace

Our global adjusted gender pay*, including
 Indian employees, shows senior management 
ratio at 0.99, middle management ratio at 0.92 
and junior management ratio at 0.96.
Adjusted Gender Pay Gap accounts for pay 
differences between men and women, considering 
factors like job role, experience, location and 
skills. Using regression analysis, we predict 
compensation based on these factors and 
calculate the gender pay gap by comparing it to 
actual (base and variable) compensation. Our 
analysis relies on the Pay Analytics platform 
developed by our technology partner, Beqom. 
Adjusted pay gap is considered to be a more 
accurate representation of gender-based pay 
disparities.

IT Security and Data Privacy
As part of its continual compliance program, 
Wipro has achieved ISO/IEC 27701 and ISO/
IEC 27018 certifications and has a robust 
data privacy framework that includes various 
governance mechanisms, policies, training, and 
tools to comply with relevant regulations and 
customer expectations. The Global Data Privacy 
Team consists of privacy professionals headed 
by the Chief Privacy Officer who reports to the 
General Counsel. Our data privacy program is 
agile and can adapt to upcoming international 
regulatory challenges and developments in 
an efficient manner along with ever-evolving 
customer expectations. The dynamic, modular, 
risk-based data privacy framework is in line with 
the cyber and information security framework, 
enabling Wipro to comply with the relevant 
regulations and industry-best privacy practices. 
Wipro has procured tools and subscribed to 
platforms like IAPP, Data Guidance and Comtrac 
to achieve this purpose. The Team enables various 
business lines in integrating privacy principles 
and methodologies to enhance the sophistication 
levels of privacy training and awareness 
throughout the organization.
Wipro’s Data Privacy policy outlines the privacy 
and data protection principles followed by Wipro 
and its entities with regard to the personal 
information of its customers, partners, employees, 
and other stakeholders. This is reviewed and 
updated at a regular stipulated frequency. Wipro 
does not share personal information with third 
parties except with consent or when legally 
required.
The Data Privacy team enables various business 
lines in integrating privacy principles and 
methodologies. Comprehensive training is 
provided to all employees on privacy incident-
management and reporting. All employees 
including contractors are required to complete 
the revised mandatory annual privacy training, 
to ensure that they understand key privacy 
concepts and principles, laws, best practices, and 
contractual obligations. We are at 92% overall 
training completion in FY24
Wipro incorporates privacy by design and its 
default principles and methodologies in its 
products, offerings, and internal applications. 
Privacy impact assessments, data mapping, 
vendor due diligence, and other measures are 
conducted regularly. These measures ensure that 
privacy requirements are embedded throughout 
the project lifecycle. The PIAs are performed 
using a risk-based approach and borrow best 
practices from industry-leading global standards.

Sustainability and Al
Emerging technologies, such as artificial 
intelligence (AI), blockchain, and augmented 
reality, have the potential to drive 
sustainability and combat climate change. 
Al has revolutionized sustainability by 
optimizing resource use, mitigating climate 
change, fostering responsible practices, 
and addressing environmental challenges. 
Al has a significant impact on sustainability 
across various business domains, including 
energy efficiency, digital transformation, 
climate change mitigation, natural resource 
management, circular economy and waste 
reduction, and disaster response and 
resilience. What then prevents the widespread 
use of Al?
Emerging technologies play a crucial 
role in advancing sustainability and offer 
solutions to combat climate change, improve 
resource management, and enhance overall 
sustainability. Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented 
Reality (AR) and other emerging technologies 
transformed digital enterprises by streamlined 
operations, increased efficiency, and 
unlocked new opportunities for growth. 
Among emerging technologies, Al plays a 
pivotal role in promoting sustainability by 
optimizing resource use, mitigating climate 
change, fostering responsible practices, and 
addressing environmental challenges.
Some key areas where Al can play a 
significant role are:
1. Energy Efficiency and Resource 
Optimization: Al has the potential to improve 
energy efficiency by optimizing operations, 
minimizing energy consumption, and 
reducing waste. Smart grids, smart airports 
and smart supply chains can be created by 
optimizing electricity distribution, improving 
efficiency and optimizing logistics.
2. Digital Transformation: There is an 
opportunity to apply sustainability 
measures across all fronts of their digital 
transformation strategy to minimize 
environmental impacts. Workload 
distribution between servers and data 
centers can be optimized using Al. Al can also 
be used to streamline software development 
processes and to maximize IT Asset 
performance by predicting and preventing 
failures. These actions optimize the energy 
consumption of IT processes, contributing to 
the organization’s Net Zero goals.
etc. by executing agreements with its affiliates, 
customers and vendors. We are committed to 
responsible transfer of data around the world. 
There were no substantiated incidents concerning 
breaches of customer privacy, PII (Personally 
Identifiable Information) and/or loss of customer 
data during FY23-24 (please see BRSR report).

3. Climate Change Mitigation: Al has 
tremendous potential in climate change 
modelling and mitigation. With the ability to 
analyze vast amounts of data, Al can improve 
modelling capabilities, thus increasing 
preparedness. Al can also be very effectively 
used in siting and designing effective 
renewable energy plants and locations for 
carbon capture.
4. Natural Resource Management: Al aids in 
monitoring and protecting environment and 
resources. For example, Al utilizes satellite 
imagery to detect deforestation, illegal 
logging, and loss of biodiversity with advanced 
technology. Al is already being effectively 
used to assist farmers in making data-driven 
decisions, and soon can be used to identify 
major leakage points in water pipelines to 
ensure water sustainability.
5. Circular Economy and Waste Reduction: Al 
has the potential to facilitate the effective and 
efficient implementation of circular economy 
principles in waste recycling, wastewater 
management and enhancing transparency in 
the supply chain.
6. Disaster Response and Resilience: Al 
enhances disaster preparedness and response 
by better predicting natural disasters (e.g., 
floods and earthquakes) and accelerating 
damage assessment with drones and image 
processing, expediting recovery efforts.
While the use of Al can seem like the perfect 
panacea for efficiency improvement and 
predictability, it is important to consider the 
other side of the coin.
The impact of Al on the planet is not 
insignificant. Few of them are listed below:
1. Energy and Emissions: The more 
sophisticated the Al model, the more 
connections there are and higher the energy 
required for computation. As per research 
done by our Think Tank, if nothing changes 
in 20 years, data centres alone will emit the 
entire CO2 emissions that our planet emits 
today. It becomes important, therefore, to 
design systems that are energy efficient or 
use alternate sources of energy.
2. Water: Data centres tend to get very heated 
due to the high computation. Typically, they 
are air-cooled. In certain cases, when the 
temperature is very high, water is also used 
for cooling purposes. A medium-sized data 
centre (15 megawatts) uses as much water 
as three average-sized hospitals, or more 
than two 18-hole golf courses. A large-size 
data centre (150 MW) will be evaporating 1 
Olympic size swimming pool of water per day. 
It is important, therefore, to get innovative 
in designing the data centres to mitigate hot 
spots as much as possible, so that it doesn’t 
get heated up and the need for water cooling 
is eliminated.
3. E-Waste: Research from Wipro’s Think Tank 
has shown that only 13-15% of data centre 
infrastructure can be recycled. That makes a 
data centre extremely resource intensive. The 
possibility of refurbishing and reusing should 
be explored as much as possible to ensure 
the sustainability of the data centres.
Intersection of sustainability and Al holds 
immense potential for improving humanity’s 
well-being while addressing global 
challenges. However, in doing so, companies 
need to address the sustainability of data 
centres. These are the new challenges - and 
opportunities - that companies will face and 
will need to address as we enter into the new 
frontiers of Al.

risks. We have a solid AI governance framework 
aimed to: 
In addition to the above, Wipro has also embarked 
on its journey toward the Gen AI intersection 
with data privacy by developing relevant policies 
and guidelines, operationalizing controls in 
core processes and developing management 
methodologies and controls assessment 
framework. The AI offerings by Wipro aim to be 
responsible at its core, generative first including 
for and driven by our people. With respect to 
GenAI, Wipro has 3 lines of defense where the 
1st line of defense is employees developing and 
deploying, AI Councils in GBLs and functions. The

not exist in isolation and we strive to achieve 
a regulatory by design approach in the way we 
deploy and build Al.
Environmental Dimension:
We support Al for sustainability alongside 
sustainable Al. The environmental footprint of 
innovation must form part of the decision making 
around the deployment of Al.
Our AI Governance Framework is 
rooted on four dimensions

The Customer Satisfaction Survey (CSAT) is 
conducted through an external partner to get 
an independent view and validation of customer 
engagement. It captures the voices of customers 
from decision makers or CXOs, influencers, 
or senior leadership at an account level. The 
annual CSAT Survey questionnaire addresses 
areas relevant to growth, viz. strategic, forward-
looking, delivery-led growth, new models of 
working, digital roadmap, and value delivery. We 
also continuously capture customer feedback 
through direct interactions, informal meetings, 
governance meetings, and senior management 
interaction with the clients. Moving forward, we 
are going to carry out an annual CSAT survey.
Key features include:
•	
Customer polling includes the decision makers 
(CXOs), influencers (senior management), 
and the operational level influencers (senior 
management).
•	
Different sets of questions for each stratum. 
CXO questions are focused on strategy and are 
futuristic. 
•	
The half-yearly survey is administered once in 
six months by a third party 
•	
Online web-based survey for all customers 
with an option to conduct interviews for CXO 
strata-based customers.
•	
Focus is on the overall strength of the 
relationship. This includes the feedback 
and feed-forward elements that would help 
identify key growth levers.
Meetings are conducted for the CSAT performance 
at SMU / GBL / Service Line / Sector/Country 
Business Heads. Qualitative text analytics help 
to identify the growth levers. The leadership 
identifies areas of improvement and appropriate 
actions. The actions are tracked, implemented, 
and closed (with the customer’s approval) at an 
account level and led by the account owner (with 
participation from the delivery head, program 
managers, quality team, and all appropriate 
service-line representatives). Periodic updates 
on progress build customer confidence in the 
process and ensure that the actions taken impact 
customer satisfaction positively and eventually 
work toward closure.

Supplier Synergies
Businesses often find their impacts or 
externalities shaped by their supply chain 
operations. The management of environmental 
and social repercussions of the supply chain 
is tied to long-term economic results. Thus, 
management can aid businesses in circumventing 
disruptions, adapting to changing customer and 
business partner needs, promoting innovation, 
and safeguarding the company’s reputation and 
brand value. It can also enhance the business 
objectives of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and 
resilience in the supply chain.
At Wipro, we strongly believe that our suppliers 
are our partners in our journey toward Net Zero 
and our sustainability journey is closely linked to 
their sustainability journey. We are committed to 
working closely with our supply chain partners 
in this journey. Our supply chain management 
program is shaped by our comprehension of the 
numerous factors and the challenges they bring.
Management Approach
Policy and Guiding Principles
The responsibility of managing procurement-
related activities of Wipro rests with the Global 
Procurement Group. The goal of the Procurement 
Group is to provide high-quality products and 
services on a timely basis, consistent with 
organizational objectives and policies and at 
the same time adhering to the highest ethical 
standards. The responsibility is divided among 
multiple buyer groups who handle different 
Wipro has a Global Procurement Policy that acts 
as an internal decision-making guide related to 
procurement. This policy details the procurement 
principles that the Global Procurement Group is 
expected to adhere to as well as other aspects 
of procurement like supplier selection, supplier 
diversity, etc. Our supply chain governance 
program is informed by four guiding principles:
procurement categories. The Procurement Group 
works along with Enterprise Risk Management, 
Internal Audit and Legal teams to ensure 
compliance and to proactively address risks in the 
supply chain.
•	
Understanding the Socio-Economic Context: 
While ambitious policies and codes of conduct 
are essential, it’s crucial to consider the 
complex socio-economic realities in which 
they are operationalized. We have built 
systems and processes to ensure adherence 
to leading procurement practices including 
assurance of human rights, corruption-
free business practices and transparent 
processes while encouraging environmentally 
sustainable business operations.
•	
Ability to Monitor, Influence, and Control: 
The ‘secondary supply chain’ extends across 
multiple tiers, and due to the complexities, 
it’s unrealistic to claim compliance across 
all tiers. Visibility is often limited to the first

one or two tiers. For non-critical supply chain 
entities, where suppliers aren’t a core part 
of our business or where the spend doesn’t 
contribute significantly to the suppliers’ 
revenue or market supply, our ability to 
influence supplier practices is limited. 
Industry bodies and large government 
procurement programs play a larger role in 
influencing change.
•	
Regulatory Compliance: Wipro follows a 
Vendor Risk Assessment policy to align 
information security assessments of critical 
suppliers/vendors with applicable policies, 
procedures, standards, and baselines. A 
security questionnaire based on industry 
frameworks like ISO 27001 and NIST 800-53 
is used to evaluate vendor security controls. 
Assessment reports, approved by relevant 
stakeholders, highlight non-conformances 
and observations. These observations are 
tracked and addressed to achieve effective 
closure. Comprehensive audits are conducted 
to assess labor practices, including working 
hours, child labor, and workplace safety. 
•	
Integrating Best Practices in Supply Chain 
Engagement: Managing supply chain 
externalities is crucial due to the deepening 
complexities in the supply chain and the 
resultant risks. Customers and investors 
consider compliance levels and ethics as 
key differentiators in their decision-making 
process. Industry forums like Electronic 
Industry Citizenship Coalition, Ecovadis, 
etc., are working towards driving continuous 
change in ethical and responsible business 
practices in global supply chains. Industry 
ratings such as SandP Global CSA (formally 
known as DJSI), Eco Vadis and CDP are 
increasingly emphasizing the supply chain 
performance of organizations. We aim to adopt 
and integrate best practices from all these 
sources to drive sustainability in our supply 
chain.
•	
Ethical: Wipro expects its partners to 
adhere to ethical procurement practices in 
accordance with Wipro’s core values, the Code 
of Business Conduct (COBC), Spirit of Wipro 
Values, and Supplier Code of Conduct (SCOC). 
We use system-enabled database checks 
for vendors across geographies, third-party 
tools for monthly labor compliance tracking in 
certain regions, and category-specific credit 
scoring of suppliers. Annual sessions on anti-
bribery and anti-corruption are conducted 
to identify high-risk geographies and social 
compliance programs for manpower services 
providers.
•	
Equitable: Wipro is an equal opportunity 
employer  committed to procuring products 
and services that are developed based on 
universal design principles and accessibility 
standards such as Harmonized Guidelines 
(HG), 2016 Government of India for physical 
infrastructure and the WCAG (Web Content 
Access Guidelines) 2.1 AA meant for ICT 
products. We consider this as critical for 
creating equitable opportunity for all users, 
especially for persons with disability. At 
present, we have a voluntary declaration 
provision for suppliers to illustrate how their 
products or services are accessible to all 
users with different abilities. 
•	
Ecological: We expect suppliers to supply 
products and services that exceed 
environmental standards and to establish a 
program of ecological sustainability in their 
own operations. Wipro is also committed to 
promoting environment-friendly practices 
in all aspects of its operations, including the 
procurement of materials and services for 
cleaning, cooling, landscaping, and safety 
practices.
Pillars of our Supplier Sustainability 
Program
Based on our understanding of risks in our supply 
chain, our supply-chain approach is based on 
the three E Principles - Ethical procurement 
practices, Equitable and open to Diversity, and 
Ecological sustainability.

Program Highlights
•	
Social Audit Program: Vendor compliance 
audit are carried out monthly, to monitor 
compliance with labor practices. The audit 
process plays a crucial role in identifying gaps 
and assessing the readiness of compliance 
requirements, as per the State-specific 
regulatory requirements. Third-party audit 
tools are used for the monthly compliance 
check. Out of 367 vendor locations identified 
for the audit, 278 vendor audit locations have 
been completed.
•	
Diversity Program: Wipro has instituted two 
flagship programs for new as well as existing 
suppliers meeting certified norms of diversity: 
the ‘Wipro Inclusion and Diversity Opportunity 
for Vendors (WINDOV)’ conducts a series of 
virtual conclaves that enable direct access for 
small suppliers to present their capabilities 
to the global procurement team and the 
‘Wipro Inclusive Supplier Development and 
Mentorship (WISDOM)’ program to strengthen 
these businesses by providing management 
and technical support to participating 
diverse suppliers. WINDOV Conclaves 
have enabled us to source goods from 
remotely located Indian tribal women and 
American businesses located in Historically 
Underutilized Businesses (HUB) zones in the 
past; whereas WISDOM interactions have 
enabled us to identify addressable barriers 
to increase our spending with the existing 
Wipro diverse suppliers. Currently, WISDOM 
is underway with manpower suppliers with a 
three-fold increase in participation. Further, to 
strengthen our Gender Response Procurement 
initiative, Wipro has launched a Women 
Entrepreneurship with Wipro (WEW) project 
that will utilize learnings from WINDOV as well 
as WISDOM.
•	
CDP Supply Chain Program: Through the 
platform we engaged with our top carbon-
intensive suppliers and encouraged 
measurement and disclosure of their 
environmental data on the CDP platform. 
Based on the disclosed emission allocations 
to Wipro, we carried out one-on-one 
discussions with few of the suppliers to 
understand their methodology and approach 
toward the reporting of emissions data on the 
platform. This year also, we will reach out to 
nearly 200 suppliers and engage with them 
actively to ensure greater participation.
•	
WISE Supply Chain Engagement: Wipro 
recently launched the Wipro Initiative for 
Supplier Engagement (WISE) Program as a 
way to engage suppliers to be part of our 
NetZero journey. Currently in a pilot stage, 
this program endeavors to work closely with 
50 of our strategic suppliers to assess their 
sustainability maturity while encouraging 
them to report on key metrics related to 
carbon, environment and social parameters.
Human Rights Assessment 
of the Value Chain
Wipro takes human Rights Assessment very 
seriously. As part of its human rights assessment 
of our supply chain, Wipro partnered with an 
external organization (DASRA) in August 2023, to 
assess the well-being practices across Wipro’s 
Tier-2 suppliers working at our campuses. The 
purpose of this assessment was to build better 
social and well-being practices within our 
suppliers through the Social Compact platform. 
The assessment focused on six key outcomes of 
informal worker practices: wages, health, access 
to entitlements, gender safety and future of work.  
The assessment was carried out in 4 cities across 
6 Wipro campuses as a pilot. It included detailed 
information gathering from the contract workforce 
as well as their direct employers (Wipro’s Tier-1 
suppliers).  
Recommendations from this study, such as 
enhanced training and awareness to the contract 
workforce by the Tier 1 suppliers, enabling a 
common format for appointment letters, etc, have 
been noted by the senior leadership, including 
the Wipro Executive Committee. This engagement 
will assist us in reflecting on our current worker 
practices, introducing remedial actions wherever 
necessary and monitoring through a social-
compliance assessment customized for Wipro 
and our supply chain

Navigating Challenges and 
the Path Ahead
The key challenges we face include vendors’ lack 
of awareness regarding labor compliance, the 
need to reassign tasks frequently due to changes 
in the vendor’s Single Point of Contacts (SPOCs), 
and the delayed resolution of non-compliance 
issues. The way forward is to streamline 
communication and enhance compliance 
awareness among vendors to expedite the 
resolution of non-compliance issues.
•	
Supply Chain Engagement
Wipro has audited 42 out of 87 engineering 
service and facility support vendor partners, 
evaluating their services against stringent 
environmental criteria.
•	
Sustainable Procurement
Our green building program follows an 
integrated approach spanning design, 
engineering services, materials and 
equipment procurement that meet stringent 
environmental criteria – both, at the 
construction and operational stages. In 
addition, we continue to procure renewable 
energy through Power Purchase Agreements 
(PPAs) from RE generators across three states 
in India. In the previous reporting year, we also 
completed an assessment of RE generators 
in two states based on the principles of the 
‘Responsible Energy Initiative’ set up by 
‘Forum for the Future’. These cover various 
social and environmental aspects in the setup 
and maintenance of power plants including 
impacts on local communities. We also 
annually assess our electronic waste recyclers 
on meeting recycling standards.

and Urban and Community Ecology. These 
initiatives have had a positive impact on the lives 
of about 4.5 million people, primarily those from 
underserved communities.
To ensure equitable access to education in 
disadvantaged communities, we worked on areas 
such as improving early childhood education 
(ECE), primary schooling, teaching-learning 
methodologies, and transforming government 
schools into quality educational institutions.
Our aim has been to encourage children and 
youth to adopt sustainability thinking and act 
on ecological issues. We collaborated with more 
than 160 partners across 28 states and union 
territories in India to improve the impact of our

We have made a conscious effort to introduce 
early interventions and champion inclusive 
education for children with disabilities 
(CwD). This process has involved empowering 
parents and raising awareness among various 
stakeholders. Leveraging the strong community 
connections of our partners, we have prioritized 
teacher training, driving positive attitudinal 
changes, developing flexible curricula, creating 
inclusive learning spaces, and promoting 
active community engagement. In addition 
to education, we also focus on the children’s 
overall health and well-being. This is done by 
identifying CwD through community outreach, 
capacity building of government staff and health 
workers, rehabilitative services for children 
with intellectual disabilities, developing social 
skills, networking for availing and facilitating 
government schemes, and providing therapy and

In FY24, our work in systemic improvement in 
quality of education, with focus on early childhood 
and primary education, reached close to 245,000 
students in collaboration with 92 organizations 
across 22 states and 3 UTs. This includes the 
25 partners we engage with through the Wipro 
Education Fellowship Program. This program 
nurtures early-stage education organizations 
committed to driving systemic change in India’s 
school education system.
Our collaboration with 44 partners across 
12 states and 1 UT has been instrumental in 
advancing educational access for ~100,000 
students from underserved communities. Through 
the ‘Urban Government School Initiative,’ we 
aim to restore infrastructure, improve teaching-
learning practices and develop model government 
schools. The Government of Karnataka has 
recognized the effectiveness of our approach and 
model. It has adopted a similar template on a 
scaled-up basis over the last two years.
We have continuously strengthened our 
engagement with partners who emphasize 
education for CwD. We work with 25 partners 
across our access and systemic reform programs, 
with a presence in 11 states and 1 UT, reaching 
over 62,000 CwDs.
Our experience of working with over 350 
organizations over the last two decades has 
revealed the critical need for capacity building for 
organizations with varying degrees of maturity. 
To address this, we have launched a non-
funded program as a pilot. Here, we do not offer 
programmatic funding. We extend our support 
to selected partners in building their capacities 
in organizational and educational aspects.
During the year, we onboarded 7 partners under 
the Capacity Building Program. Our initiatives 
have helped develop our partners’ capacities 
through training and mentoring in the key areas of 
foundational literacy, numeracy, STEM education, 
library education, and supplementary education.

A Second Chance at Life: Asima's Journey to Motherhood
Asima is a 28-year-old young mother living in a 
peri-urban slum in Kolkata. During a pregnancy, 
she battled numerous medical conditions. These 
included hypothyroidism, thalassemia and 
diabetes. She also had two miscarriages earlier. 
This made her pregnancy high-risk. 
Abandoned by her husband, she had no one 
to turn to. She chose to move back in with her 
parents. They struggled to care for her. It was 
only when a CINI didi visited her during a door-
to-door outreach program that Asima’s medical 
condition came to light.

190,000 women within the reproductive age 
group, 380,000 infants and children, and around 
1,500 children with disabilities.
Since FY21, our outreach efforts in primary 
healthcare have impacted a total population 
of 3.8 million, reaching 420,000 women in the 
reproductive age group, 760,000 children and 
infants, and 3,100 children with disabilities.
The CINI didi promptly referred her to an advanced 
medical care facility. She also undertook 
subsequent follow-ups and counseling. All of these 
made a difference to Asima's health. Despite her 
severe medical complications, Asima’s spirit and 
the CINI didi’s efforts ensured that she gave birth 
to a healthy baby. 
The care and support that Asima received did 
not end there. The CINI didi continued to follow-
up with Asima. She ensured that the young 
mother received adequate support and advice on 
immunizing her child. 
“Through the care and support of CINI didi, I could 
experience health and happiness, once again. As a 
mother, I urge all expectant mothers to seek their 
help in this journey of motherhood,” shares Asima.  
Wipro has been working in collaboration with 
their CSO partner CINI, with Kolkata Municipal 
Corporation, Urban Health Mission, and ICDS. This 
initiative has supported 700+ pregnant women 
and lactating mothers in this urban region to gain 
timely access to healthcare.

At Wipro, our commitment is twofold – embedding 
sustainability within our business practices 
and championing initiatives that enhance urban 
ecology. The Urban Ecology Small Grants Program 
encourages local environmental restoration. The 
Urban Waters Program advocates for resilient, 
people-centric urban water management 
practices. It is active in water-stressed cities such 
as Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune.
In FY24, we supported participatory water 
management practices in six (6) cities. The goal 
was to enhance water sustainability and resilience 
within urban environments. We facilitated 
community grant projects that empowered 11 
local organizations in Bengaluru, Chennai and 
Hyderabad, to make a positive impact. We co-
organized the third edition of the Urban Waters 
Forum, in collaboration with IIT Bombay, with 140 
participants. This event encourages knowledge 
exchange among Wipro’s partners, experts and 
stakeholders working on water management. The 
website urbanwaters.in was launched to serve as 
a resource hub and showcase the best practices in 
water-stressed cities.
Wipro Foundation has co-convened an inter-
institutional initiative called the Bengaluru 
Sustainability Forum (BSF). Its mandate 
is to enable conversations and promote 
interdisciplinary collaborations on sustainability 
in Bengaluru. BSF has become an important 
Urban and Community Ecology
space in the city for wide-ranging discussions 
on issues related to urban sustainability. It also 
runs a successful small grants program, which 
supports action-oriented projects for the urban 
environment. Between FY21 and FY24, a total of 10 
grants were awarded.
Under the community ecology initiative, we focus 
on striking ecological balance in our proximate 
communities. We do this by taking up projects 
that deliver direct and tangible benefits. In FY24, 
15,600+ people from the informal waste sector 
in Bengaluru and Mysuru were supported with 
training, upskilling, social security, and health 
camps. In Coimbatore, we planted 50,000 trees 
over 100 acres and provided agroforestry training 
to farmers. In Bhubaneswar, we supported 
infrastructural work for water storage and 
distribution, providing clean water to 500 tribal 
households.

National Geographic and Wipro Present ‘The Butterfly Effect’
Water Transformation in Phirkinali Village, Odisha
“The Butterfly Effect,” a short film by National 
Geographic and Wipro, premiered on the 
National Geographic Channel in India in 
December 2023. The film delves into the heart 
of Wipro’s sustainability story, our community 
initiatives, and our commitment to Net Zero. It 
is also a metaphor for our impact on the world 
– a reminder that even small actions create 
ripple effects that resonate far beyond our 
initial intentions.
In a heartwarming tale of resilience and 
collaboration, Phirkinali village in Odisha has 
undergone a remarkable transformation. For 
years, its residents faced the challenges of 
open defecation, insufficient bathing facilities, 
and a lack of clean drinking water. 
However, thanks to the joint efforts of women 
from six tribal villages, Gram Vikas (a local 
non-profit organization), and Wipro, the village 
now has round-the-clock access to running 
water. At the center of this transformation is a 
30,000-liter overhead water tank. It is a beacon 
of hope for the 78 families residing in Phirkinali. 
Each household now enjoys the convenience 
of three taps: one in the kitchen, one in the 
bathroom, and a third in the toilet. Ensuring 
access to clean water and basic sanitation is 
a critical step toward securing a healthier and 
more prosperous future for these communities.

Sustainable Cities: Our Collective Endeavor
As part of our commitment to urban ecological 
sustainability, we awarded 11 small grants to 
groups in Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad. Our 
initiatives included backing the Climate Dialogue 
Series, a film festival, and the Urban Ecology 
Design Competition.
A severe water crisis struck Bengaluru in 2023. 
This was exacerbated by a poor monsoon season 
and declining groundwater levels. As a response, 
our partners took the initiative to compile 
resources and educate residents on water 
conservation practices.
Citizen Action to Conserve Groundwater in Pune
Bhujal Abhiyan Trust, Pune, is a Wipro Foundation 
partner in our Urban Ecology Program.  
Together we have spearheaded a citizen-led 
effort to establish a Groundwater Cell within 
Pune Municipal Corporation. The goal is to 
influence policy through citizens’ advocacy, with 
practical demonstration and implementation of 
groundwater recharge as its foundation. 
The entire campaign has been led by Bhujal 
Abhiyan members. The process has included 
the conceptualization of the Groundwater Cell 
for urban local bodies, detailing their roles, 
responsibilities, objectives, and composition 
of members. The Groundwater Cell is planned 
to comprise government officials, experts, 
and representatives from NGOs and civil 
society. Inputs from experts from other partner 
organizations like Advanced Centre for Water 
Resources Development and Management 
(ACWADAM) have also been a critical part of the 
process. 
These efforts have resulted in the formation of 
India’s first citizen-centric Groundwater Cell in 
an urban local body. This Cell can potentially 
play a significant role in addressing groundwater 
management issues in the region. There is 
potential for this model to be replicated across 
India, as an example of participatory community-
led groundwater management.

Disaster Response
Public spaces are crucial for fostering social 
integrity, inclusion, democracy and empathy. 
They enhance community bonds, safety, 
security, and civic participation. Since 2018, our 
CSR charter has been dedicated to nurturing 
inclusive public spaces. The two major projects 
we support that act as inclusive public spaces 
are the Bangalore International Center (BIC) and 
the Museum of Art and Photography (MAP). BIC 
has been running well for more than six years 
now. It has rapidly become a vibrant hub for 
diverse conversations and cultural events. MAP 
has a library with rare books on art and history 
housed across two floors. It also has special 
initiatives for making art accessible for persons 
with disability. 
Natural disasters such as earthquakes, 
floods and cyclones disproportionately 
affect vulnerable communities. Their already 
precarious livelihoods are further disrupted. 
Since the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, we have 
responded to various natural disasters such 
as Uttarakhand floods, Tamil Nadu floods, 
Kerala floods, and cyclone Amphan, among 
others. Our approach considers geography, 
culture, and the socioeconomic context. Our 
commitment extends beyond immediate relief. 
It also focuses on sustainable recovery and 
community empowerment.
In FY24, we delivered essential disaster relief 
to 267 families impacted by the flooding in 
Anna Nagar and the riverbed areas of Delhi. Our 
efforts encompassed distributing emergency 
food supplies and medicines and setting up 
medical camps. We also conducted health 
awareness programs on waterborne diseases to 
support the affected communities during this 
critical time.

The United Kingdom: Wipro SEF UK was launched 
in FY19, in partnership with King’s College, 
London (KCL), and Sheffield Hallam University 
(SHU). The KCL program is the UK’s first Masters 
in STEM Education Program. It offers up to 15 
bursaries per year to in-service and early-career 
STEM teachers. Wipro Teacher Fellowship and 
Wipro Teacher Mentor Program are the focus of 
our partnership with Sheffield Hallam University 
(SHU). The goal of the partnership is to provide 
continuous professional development to STEM 
teachers. Through these programs, we have 
supported 45+ fellows, mentors, and senior 
mentors this year.
International Community Initiatives
In FY24, Wipro’s community initiatives were 
operational in 17 countries across the world. 
These have been structured around the three 
thematic areas of digital skills, youth inclusion, 
and the environment. We developed partnerships 
with over 30 organizations and supported more 
than 30 projects. In the process, we reached 
12,000 people in the communities where 
Wiproites live and work. Wipro employees 
dedicated thousands of volunteered hours to 
support these causes.
In the Americas, we have been advancing 
digital skills and empowering the youth. In the 
US, we partnered with schools and groups like 
Technovation to prepare children for their future 
careers. In Canada, we worked with Making 
Changes to help women re-enter the ICT sector. In 
Brazil, we mentored youth from underprivileged 
areas, collaborating with the Amigos do Bem non-
profit organization to combat poverty.
In Europe, we developed activities in every region 
Wipro has a presence in. In the UK, we partnered 
with Generation to empower individuals through 
masterclasses and mock interviews, enabling 
access to employment opportunities. We also 
collaborated with Thames21 to maintain clean 
rivers in London and the UK. Additionally, we 
supported Gaydio Academy to equip LGBTQIA+ 
youth with essential skills.
In France, we championed animal rights with 
SPA and aided young people in care with SOS 
Children’s Villages. In Poland, we supported young 
individuals in institutional care with Fundacja 
Robinson. In Switzerland, with Powercoders, 
we helped train migrants and refugees in IT. In 
Sweden, we worked with Fryshuset for youth 
inclusion. In the Netherlands, we mentored 
Codam’s IT students. In Romania, we created 
the Wipro Forest for a greener future and have 
supported Teach for Romania for over seven years 
to enhance education in disadvantaged areas. 
Additionally, we empowered women with IT skills 
through Education for Open Society, boosting 
their reemployment.
In the APMEA region, we focused on youth 
inclusion projects. In the Philippines, we 
supported young adults in Alternative Learning 
Systems and young inmates in prison to enhance 
their employable skills. In South Africa, the 
Wipro Graduate Academy provided intense 
digital and soft skills training for underprivileged 
youth, bridging the gap between training and 
employment.
In Australia, our focus was on building community 
resilience against the effects of climate change.

Ambitions Realized

The Wipro team in Romania has always had 
bold ambitions and deep commitment to 
support local communities. They have been 
partnering with a local nonprofit organization, 
EcoAssist, for the last 9 years and have been 
planting trees across the country. 
In 2023, the team decided to take a bold action 
to mitigate the effects of climate change. 
They planted the very first Wipro Forest. An 
important goal of this project is also to help 
local communities become more resilient. It 
had Wiproites join hands as a team, as a part of 
the whole organizational ecosystem. The Wipro 
Forest embodies the vision of community and 
a sustainable future. It transcends the typical 
company planting event. It hopes to evolve 
into a holistic ecosystem where business, 
education, and environmental initiatives 
converge. 
Two key objectives have guided the decision to 
plant the Wipro Forest. The first one is to be a 
good citizen and invest in breathable air and 
climate stability for future generations. This 
initiative has added another layer of efforts 
to Wipro’s commitment to Net Zero. The Wipro 
Forest has 20,000 saplings planted across 
an area of four (4) hectares. The planting took 
place  during the autumn of 2023 and the 
spring of 2024, on a terrain that comes with a 
climate need. 
The mixed woodlands are estimated to store 
103.2 tons of carbon per year after five (5) 
years, with the amount increasing to 188 tons 
per year by the 10th year of their life. Over 
a 30-year lifespan, this cumulative carbon 
storage would reach 28,200 tons per year. 
The tree species represent the core of the 
ecosystem they will generate, with future 
forests becoming a biodiversity hotspot for 
both flora and fauna. 
The trees will capture dust from the 
atmosphere, allowing the four (4) hectares 
to retain nearly 140 tons of dust per year. 
The forest will reduce wind speed, leading to 
decreased water evaporation intensity from 
the soil. It will also act as a barrier against 
winds and snow in the area. The soil will be 
protected, and its fertility will increase over 
time.  
This process has also helped nurture an 
ecosystem of stakeholders engaged in 
environmental preservation and in the fight 
against climate change. More than 200 Wipro

employees, and their families and friends, 
have been participating regularly in these 
plantation drives. Employees of Wipro clients 
and local communitiy members have taken 
part in the planting events as well. 
The team has also been able to mobilize Teach 
for Romania, a partner in the country, to join 
the planting efforts. Teach for Romania’s 
teachers, and students from underserved 
communities accompanied by these teachers, 
have had hands-on learning opportunities 
to gain firsthand experience in ecological 
conservation. This has shaped, and further 
nurtured, their understanding of sustainability 
and a breathable future for all. 
A teacher participating through Teach for 
Romania shared, “The children from two 
classes supported by Wipro enthusiastically 
participated in their second tree-planting 
event in Baicoi, Prahova County, alongside 
the local Forestry Department. Tree planting 
was not only a practical activity but also 
an opportunity for students to learn about 
natural cycles and the impact we have on the 
environment. We are grateful to our partner 
and the students from the two schools in 
Calarasi for their active involvement and 
passion for environmental protection. Together, 
we have sown the seeds of a new generation of 
responsible citizens ready to take on the role 
of protecting our planet.”
More than 300 volunteers from different 
communities and backgrounds have been 
adding their footprint to the ecosystem 
through the Wipro Forest initiative. Future 
generations will inherit this ecosystem rich 
in biodiversity and a legacy of environmental 
stewardship and responsibility.
