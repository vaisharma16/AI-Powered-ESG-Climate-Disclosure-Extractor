  "What net-zero or climate targets has the company disclosed?": {
    "answer": "Unilever aims for Net Zero emissions by 2039.  This target excludes indirect consumer use-phase emissions (optional under the GHG Protocol and SBTi).  Their current near-term targets cover Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions (excluding the optional indirect emissions), aiming for a 39% absolute reduction in total targeted Scope 3 emissions. This 39% reduction is split between emissions from forest, land, and agriculture (FLAG) and those from energy and industry.  In 2021, their baseline GHG emissions were 56 million tonnes CO2e, reduced to 53 million tonnes CO2e by 2023.  These near-term targets are pending SBTi validation.",
